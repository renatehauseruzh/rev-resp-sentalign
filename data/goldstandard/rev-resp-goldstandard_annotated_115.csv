3287424,50000001,We stayed in a 2BR unit which had stunning views of the valley.,,80000001,It is great to see that you were able to enjoy a family getaway with us at the Estate.,
3287424,50000002,It was quite spacious and comfortable.,,80000002,We are working towards renovating all our rooms at the Estate to keep them fresh and appealing for all guests during their stay.,
3287424,50000003,I will add that the décor seemed a bit worn.,80000002,80000003,I have also passed your kind words on to our Rae's Restaurant after you enjoyed your meal with us.,
3287424,50000004,We had a very pleasant check-in and were impressed by the woman at reception who was managing two surly guests with grace while we waited.,,80000004,We hope to welcome you and your family back for another visit soon.,
3287424,50000005,The complaints we heard were ridiculous and she was so composed.,,80000005,Kind Regards Charlotte,
3287424,50000006,She checked us in quickly and in a friendly manner.,,,,
3287424,50000007,We enjoyed a the walking trail around the property and our teen girls liked the giant chess game on the lawn.,,,,
3287424,50000008,"We had dinner at Rae's, which was delicious and allowed for an incredible view as well.",80000003,,,
3287424,50000009,The estate is well located near wineries and the chocolatier and was a easy drive to our early balloon flight.,,,,

3173251,50000010,Very good hotel ---SEP--- Stayed here for work for one night.,,80000010,Hello KatMcP,
3173251,50000011,"Staff were extremely friendly, greeting me as I got out of the lift (reception is on 1st floor) and asking lots of genuine questions about why I was there and how they could help.",,80000011,"Firstly, great to hear your room was super clean, ill let the housekeeping team and Klaudia know( they probably read this as they all do) Some of our rooms are a bit of a weird shape its true, this is due to the nature of the building and as such we have tried to make the most of natural light and the space itself.",
3173251,50000012,"Room was possibly the cleanest I have ever stayed in, but didn't' appear to have a window until I found it hidden behind a wardrobe in the small alcove at the back right of the room.",80000011,80000012,We are a square building,
3173251,50000013,Even then it only overlooked a small light well about 12 foot wide but which was so tall I couldn't actually see sky/the weather at the top!,80000011,80000013,"so yes, some rooms look onto others, these internal rooms are the favourites of the ""in the know"" guests who like a deep sleep as they are silent.",
3173251,50000014,"Weirder still you look straight into other rooms which made me close the curtains to my room despite it only being mid afternoon, so there was essentially no window in the room.",80000013; 80000014,80000014,You can always draw the net curtain for privacy while still allowing for natural light.,
3173251,50000015,"This is my only criticism, and a fairly minor one at that.",,80000015,Sounds like everything else was peachy though.,
3173251,50000016,Decor is quirky but functional and the free breakfast is plentiful and tasty.,,80000016,God times.,
3173251,50000017,"Location is excellent, just a few minutes from both main train stations and a few steps from the shopping and most main areas.",,80000017,My best Rory,
3173251,50000018,I had a good nights sleep and really appreciated the USB socket next to the.bed for phone chargers!,,,,

3319214,50000052,We had to request toast 3 times one morning and when it eventually came it was without butter!,80000050,80000052,Best wishes Lynn,
3319214,50000053,They appeared to not want to serve more than 1 glass of fruit juice per person either.,,,,
3319214,50000054,On Saturday evening it was busy so we expected a wait,,,,
3319214,50000055,"but it was about an hour each between the starter, main and dessert and even then they forgot the extras we had ordered.",80000050,,,

3319214,50000058,We ordered cocktails but they had run out of cocktail glasses in which to serve them in.,,,,
3319214,50000059,Not quite the same having a cosmopolitan served in a brandy glass!,,,,
3319214,50000060,The staff appeared to lack training on what constitutes good customer service.,80000050,,,
3319214,50000061,"Housekeeping brilliant, as was reception.",,,,
3319214,50000062,The hotel has the potential to be a great hotel but just needs to address the restaurant problems and get the basics,80000050,,,

3161840,50000105,Housekeeping carts blocked movement in hallway - why can't Marriott be cutting edge and develop or adopt Asian hidden housekeeping?,80000083,,,
3161840,50000106,"Finally, it seems as though if the hotel strategically places tip envelopes for housekeeping staff why not for other employees?",,,,

3250583,50000391,My partner booked two nights for our anniversary and I was really looking forward to it having read all the reviews and looked at pics.,80000341; 80000342,80000341,I am delighted to see you had high expectations prior to your arrival due to the research you did on third party review sites such as Trip Advisor.,
3250583,50000392,We had a suite with a bar in it,,80000342,"The overwhelming comments on these sites by guests who have stayed at The Twelve are namely about::- 1) how wonderful the staff are, 2) how great their dining experiences were, 3) how wonderul the atmosphere is and 4) how true the Twelve's website is to actual reality.",
3250583,50000393,"but it was structure only, had a microwave but no cutlery or plates and mini bar had no red or white wine, but for a €5 euro service charge they brought some wine.",,80000343,You can therefore understand my disappointment when we did not live up to your expectations on the latter two.,
3250583,50000394,On arrival there was a drill on one of the tables apparently someone was putting a hook on bathroom door.,,80000344,The Twelve is very much unlike the vast majority of hotels and this is why it is so well liked.,
3250583,50000395,Went for a drink in the Pins Bar to get over our long trip and providing there is no one in the bar you can get table service.,80000345,80000345,Our local bar atmosphere is an integral part of our successful formula and it is something we shout about proudly on our website.,
3250583,50000396,"Thankfully and the one thing that saved our break was the West restaurant where the food is without reservation some of the best I have ever tasted, and the wine selection amazing, would go back for the food but would probably stay elsewhere it was €199 per night that did include breakfast and our meal in The West (no wine).",80000347; 80000348; 80000349,80000346,It is this beautiful buzz which helps make The Twelve what it is.,
3250583,50000397,I had read that they had jazz in The Pins but sadly not anymore.,80000350; 80000351; 80000352; 80000353; 80000354,80000347,"Along with our staff and perfect location, the other wonderful elements are our devotion to great food and wine.",
3250583,50000398,On second day we went for a drive to explore had a lovely day but when we came back football was on and no seats in The Pins and no residents bar.,,80000348,I am delighted to see you had a terrific experience in West.,
3250583,50000399,I cannot honestly say it was a complete washout,,80000349,We have been greatly honoured with numerous accolades for West's cuisine as well as our wine list which has won pretty much every wine award there is to win.,
3250583,50000400,"but it was also not what they bill it as on their site, so by all means go, worth it for food alone but don't bother with the overpriced suites, we spent no time in the extra space as there was nothing in it.",80000342;,80000350,We do feature free live entertainment every weekend.,
3250583,50000401,I presume that the reason we had no bath in the room was because we had the bar not worth it.,80000356; 80000343,80000351,"On Fridays, it is always Traditional Irish music sessions - really good sessions.",
3250583,,,,80000352,"Saturdays, however lend thmselves to more variety.",
3250583,,,,80000353,"Sometimes it is Jazz, other times it is Blues.",
3250583,,,,80000354,We always try to mix it up and the reason for this is based upon feedback from our guests.,
3250583,,,,80000355,Our Facebook page always has the most up to the minute infomation.,
3250583,,,,80000356,There are two end suites in the hotel which were designed for guests who want walk in showers rather than a bath.,
3250583,,,,80000357,"When you book directly on The Twelve's official website, you are given the luxury of choice.",
3250583,,,,80000358,"Unfortunately, this is not possible on third party sites.",
3250583,,,,80000359,"Labella, I really wish you had given us the opportunity to make some sort of service recovery whilst you were staying with us.",

3214363,50012251,"First big plus, as the name suggests, is that it’s on Bryant Park which imparts sunlight and space in front of the hotel and gets away from the often claustrophobic nature of high rise streets in NYC (getting a Suite or a park facing room will make the most of the view)",,80009581,I couldn't wait to show John and Ricardo your review.,

3276454,50012391,"This is a newer Residence Inn, and a notch above other Residence Inn's I've stayed in.",,80009701,"We are happy to hear you enjoyed our hotel, location and rooms.",
3276454,50012392,They offer the typical roomy Residence Inn studios and suites with every amenity required.,,80009702,We have a salt water pool at the hotel and do not use chlorine.,
3276454,50012393,Of note was how quiet the room was.,80009701,80009703,We apologize for the chemical smell as the pool deck was being cleaned at that time.,
3276454,50012394,"Even though it's downtown, and even though there were rooms full of celebrating grads down the hall, I heard nothing.",,80009704,We hope that next time you will be able to enjoy our pool.,
3276454,50012395,It must be well built with extra thick walls or soundproofing.,,80009705,We appreciate the recommendation and we hope to see you back again soon.,
3276454,50012396,A very peaceful and restful sleep in the most comfortable of beds.,,80009706,"Warm Regards, Darlene Power",
3276454,50012397,"The staff is helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast offers lots of variety.",,,,
3276454,50012398,They have one free computer to use in the lobby.,,,,
3276454,50012399,"I did not use the pool, but it looked clean.",80009704,,,
3276454,50012400,I expect though that it may be over-chlorinated as the smell was powerful.,80009703,,,
3276454,50012401,"Parking is $12.00/night for hotel guests, with in and out privileges.",,,,
3276454,50012402,"Make sure you have the front desk validate your parking stub, and retrieve it from the machine every time you exit.",,,,
3276454,50012403,Compared to its nearby competition - the Delta and Rodd - I certainly recommend the Residence Inn.,,,,
,,,,,,
3316406,50012410,"Staff friendly, the rest not to recommend ---SEP---",,80009710,"As you mentioned, we have been renovating the hallways and just just the 5th floor but all of them.",
3316406,50012411,We had a warm welcome at the Ocean Sky and got rooms 908 and 910 with a connecting door.,,80009711,We also have many plans in the near future.,
3316406,50012412,"The door has not been used for a while, and has been paintet in the meantime that the color sticked the door to the wall....",,80009712,We hope that you give us another opportunity soon.,
3316406,50012413,"After we opened it, you can imagine how dirty it was in between these two doors.",,80009713,Thank you.,
3316406,50012414,One of the fridges was full of melted ice and so we called the front desk.,,80009714,Paul Cahaly General Manager,
3316406,50012415,A friendly room maid came immediately and cleaned the old carpet.,,,,
3316406,50012416,"As we had another fridge in the second room, it was not that bad that the dirty fridge stayed dirty until our departure.",,,,
3316406,50012417,The balconies were very clean and the chairs comfortable.,,,,
3316406,50012418,The view is great – also during the night with the ocean on one and the lights of the city on the other side.,,,,
3316406,50012419,The pool was nice and the area more or less clean.,,,,
3316406,50012420,"When we arrived there by 5 pm, we 6 were happy, cause we got the last 3 pool towels.",,,,
3316406,50012421,The lady at the poolbar could not organize more towels cause she was not in charge.,,,,
3316406,50012422,Opening hours oft he pool: 7.am to 11 pm.,,,,
3316406,50012423,On a normal thursday no towels for the pool for more than a third of the whole opening time.,,,,
3316406,50012424,"Well, so we did not have to try the pool bar – maybe the lady would also not be in charge.",,,,
3316406,50012425,The old shower next to the pool was fun.,,,,
3316406,50012426,We did not know that something like that still exists.,,,,
3316406,50012427,There is an elevator directly from the pool deck to the rooms.,,,,
3316406,50012428,This elevator was not working during our whole stay.,,,,
3316406,50012429,"Like this, we had to walk through the lobby with furniture of the fifties.",,,,
3316406,50012430,A few more years and they will be modern again.,,,,
3316406,50012431,Parking costs $12 per night which is a moderate prize.,,,,
3316406,50012432,And what we really appreciate is the free WiFi.,,,,
3316406,50012433,This is a service we think is great.,,,,
3316406,50012434,What will await you in room 910: Aircondition is very old and loud but works.,,,,
3316406,50012435,"Not too confortable when you want to sit on the chair when it’s hot, cause the aircondition will blow warm air in your neck.",,,,
3316406,50012436,2 Lamps by the bed: are dirty but they work.,,,,
3316406,50012437,Water in the bathroom:,,,,
3316406,50012438,There is one way to stop the water: Bring it to one special position and try hard and you will manage that the water will not run the whole night.,,,,
3316406,50012439,On the Hotel Information Manual you will find half of a chocolate bar on the second page.,,,,
3316406,50012440,It looks like the room maids haven’t looked at it for a while – so maybe you’ll find it.,,,,
3316406,50012441,"Opening the balcony’s door is another challenge, but you will manage – as we did.",,,,
3316406,50012442,What you will find in room 908:,,,,
3316406,50012443,The lamp standing next tot he window does not work.,,,,
3316406,50012444,The same lamp as in the other room but luckily in the other room there was a button to bring it to work.,,,,
3316406,50012445,"We shouldn't have used the 3 coffee portions the first day, cause they haven't been refilled the coming day.",,,,
3316406,50012446,On the 5th floor we once saw workers come into the elevator.,,,,
3316406,50012447,It seems like there are a few things they renew.,,,,
3316406,50012448,"So I would suggest if you still are thinking of going to that hotel, maybe you could ask for a room on a floor that has been renewed.",,,,
3316406,50012449,"If the rooms would be as nice as the staff at the valet parking, front desk, concierge are friendly, it would be a lovely place.",,,,
3316406,50012450,"Why it's called ""Resort"" is another question....",,,,
3316406,50012451,With the check-out we mentioned that we did not like it there at all.,,,,
3316406,50012452,The lady at the front desk was very sorry and told me to tell it the room service manager too...,,,,
3316406,50012453,The problem of a bad condition of the rooms can unfortunately not be solved by only a room service manager...,,,,
,,,,,,
3326663,50012460,Our first stay here.,,80009720,Thanks for the great review Graham and Janet.,
3326663,50012461,"But, not our last.",,80009721,It was lovely to have 'Whitby regulars' stay!,
3326663,50012462,---SEP---,,80009722,Hope you see you again soon.,
3326663,50012463,"From the ease of booking, through to check out, everything was 100%.",,,,
3326663,50012464,"Phill and Sophie are a wonderful couple, very welcoming and helpful.",,,,
3326663,50012465,"We stayed in the luxury room, on the top floor.",,,,
3326663,50012466,"The room very clean and well appointed, with a very nice bathroom.",,,,
3326663,50012467,"The breakfast is a standard choice, with a daily special, and the quality of the ingredients was first class.",,,,
,,,,,,
3176764,50012470,Relaxing stay ---SEP---,,80009730,"Dear kris091, Thank you very much for your feedback (particulalry on the menu offerings) and for taking the time to let us know how you felt.",
3176764,50012471,We just got back from a week long holiday at Peppers Palm Cove.,,80009731,On some occasions when the weather chops and changes we do find it challenging from time to time to maintain the appropriate staff on duty to serve.,
3176764,50012472,Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best and we had several rainy days however what begins as a rainy day in Palm Cove can then turn into a beautiful sunny day a few hours later!,,80009732,We are working on improving this aspect of our service.,
3176764,50012473,Obviously this isn't the fault of Peppers and they had plenty of umbrellas on hand when needed.,,80009733,Chef is releasing a new menu on July 1 and we have also completely renovated the kichen and bar which is due to re-open on June 25.,
3176764,50012474,We had a 2 bedroom ocean front suite that we shared with my parents which was great and offered maximum privacy for each group.,,80009734,"Kind regards, Chris & team",
3176764,50012475,The king size beds and pillows were really comfortable and the sound of the ocean waves crashing was beautiful to listen to.,,,,
3176764,50012476,The rooms were clean and serviced daily which is great coming back to a clean and tidy room.,,,,
3176764,50012477,I was a little disappointed with the room service menu though.,,,,
3176764,50012478,There were a couple of times we just felt like something simple to eat like a toasted sandwich or club sandwich but the room service menu is from the restaurant Lime and Pepper which I felt had limited options.,,,,
3176764,50012479,I ended up having the gourmet beef burger one night which was just ok.,,,,
3176764,50012480,I also felt like a dessert on another occasion but they sounded quite unappetising (pumpkin pudding with pineapple or plum mousse with sweet curry sauce).,,,,
3176764,50012481,However I didn't call and ask if I could get something more simple so maybe there is more available if you ask?,,,,
3176764,50012482,"But Palm Cove has an amazing selection of restaurants, Vivo Bar and Grill was our absolute favourite and Il Forno Pizzeria was also great fun.",,,,
3176764,50012483,The main pool at Peppers is amazing and was the main reason we booked to stay there as we were all keen on sitting around the gorgeous pool and swimming.,,,,
3176764,50012484,I read somewhere that it was one of the only hotels in Palm Cove that had a heated swimming pool.,,,,
3176764,50012485,However none of the pools were heated and they were all really really cold!,,,,
3176764,50012486,We had one great sunny day that we all sat around the pool and swam however I could only get in for a very short time and didn't want to brave it again.,,,,
3176764,50012487,I had to get my son out when his lips turned blue!,,,,
3176764,50012488,We all had a swim but would have loved the water to have been a few degrees warmer so we were more comfortable.,,,,
3176764,50012489,"I left the main pool at one stage to go and get in the spa to get warm but it too was freezing, how strange.",,,,
3176764,50012490,Another issue was the pool bar.,,,,
3176764,50012491,A gentleman waiting behind me at one stage called it a debacle and I would have to agree.,,,,
3176764,50012492,"We were so disappointed that they didn't come around and take your drink and food orders around the pool, instead you had to go up to the bar and wait, order and wait again 15 to 20 mins for your cocktails and then carry them back on a tray which just didn't seem to be a 5 star way of doing things and ended up being a real pain and put a lot of pressure on the bar staff who were busy making cocktails whilst an irritated line of people watched on.",80009731,,,
3176764,50012493,"However you can order food at the bar and they will bring it out to you, make sure you get the bucket of chips, they are in a huge bucket and were really yummy but again would have loved to see some more simple snack items on the menu that weren't deep fried like chicken or ham sandwich.",80009730,,,
3176764,50012494,After indulging at each breakfast and dinner sometimes you feel like something light for lunch or afternoon snack by the pool.,,,,
3176764,50012495,"We all thought the breakfast, which was included in our package, was great.",,,,
3176764,50012496,A lot of variety and really yummy way to start the day.,,,,
3176764,50012497,We didn't end up using the free wifi as it was pretty slow.,,,,
3176764,50012498,The staff were all friendly and helpful when asked.,,,,
3176764,50012499,My husband and I had a massage at the day spa which was lovely but pretty expensive and the hard sell of their products at the end turned me right off.,,,,
3176764,50012500,Overall we had a really relaxing and fun holiday and were happy with the accommodation and service.,,,,
,,,,,,
3176623,50012510,Great stay ---SEP---,,80009740,"Hi barahsuxton, thank you for the review of your stay here at Cambridge City East.",
3176623,50012511,Even though we had some preconceptions about the Premier Inn we were pleasantly surprised at our stay.,,80009741,"We are so pleased to hear that you thought the beds were comfy, and rooms a decent size.",
3176623,50012512,The rooms were decently sized and the beds were superbly comfy!,80009741,80009742,It is our aim to make our guests feel brilliant through a great nights sleep!,
3176623,50012513,"(In fact, I had the best sleep of my trip here despite stay at more expensive hotels).",,80009743,"Kind regards, Premier Inn Team",
3176623,50012514,The hotel is in a good location and is in walking distance of the various colleges.,,,,

3173717,50012561,My husband and I visit Denver often as our son goes to Denver Uni.,,80009781,It was a pleasure hosting you as always.,
3173717,50012562,"Howver, this time we visited after I injured myself skiing in Vail.",,80009782,We are glad to hear you were able to enjoy some of the great offerings at the hotel to include our restaurant Narrative and the Vero water filling stations.,
3173717,50012563,We tried the Jacquard due to its great location in Cherry Creek.,,80009783,As for the troubles you encountered concerning odor and warm water in the commode.,
3173717,50012564,No complaints there with walking distance to the best shopping and restaurants.,,80009784,We have worked to rectify both of these issues.,
3173717,50012565,"Hotel beds were very comfortable, breakfasts in their Restaurant wonderful.",80009782,80009785,"However, I would like to sincerely apologize for these problems.",

3173717,50012569,So all good -,,80009789,"Sincerely,",
3173717,50012570,BUT from the moment we entered our room on the fifth floor we noticed a bad smell - as if someone forgot to flush the toilet or perhaps even gas from fridge.,80009783; 80009784; 80009785,,,
3173717,50012571,We checked and all fine.,,,,
3173717,50012572,Told reception who said they would get housekeeping to check it while we were out.,,,,
3173717,50012573,My son had stayed in the room and said no one showed up.,,,,
3173717,50012574,We found if we closed the toilet lid and bathroom door we could control the smell but ideally we should have changed rooms.,,,,
3173717,50012575,Over four days we noticed the same smell also in a lift and other guests also noticed it.,,,,
3173717,50012576,Then we realized the water in the toilet was going warm - which came to our attention because we left the lid down.,,,,
3173717,50012577,So when we lifted it there was heat.,,,,
3173717,50012578,I used to work in hospitality and noticed the engineer in the lift once so brought it to his attention.,,,,
3173717,50012579,Was still not fixed while we were there and no one offered to move us or checked in with us about the complaint.,,,,
3173717,50012580,Very disappointing.,,,,
3173717,50012581,I got the feeling that the problem is well known by Hotel staff and it’s a nasty one at that.,,,,
3173717,50012582,Strangest thing ever and definitely coming from the clean toilet water - perhaps it is something in the pipes?!,,,,
3173717,50012583,I hope it is just teething problems but will avoid this Hotel for a while in the hope it will get sorted.,,,,
3173717,50012584,Weird!,,,,

3307946,50012811,I stayed here on business 6/24-6/25/2019.,,80009961,We do appreciate the feedback.,
3307946,50012812,It's budget hotel and my expectations weren't especially high,,,,
3307946,50012813,"so I didn't take issue with the super low-flow shower pressure, loud A/C or lukewarm breakfast buffet and coffee.",,,,
3307946,50012814,What drove me to write this review was the absolutely awful customer service I received from the front desk manager on the night of 6/24.,,,,
3307946,50012815,I dropped off laundry monday am and was told it would be back in my room 6-7pm.,,,,
3307946,50012816,When I returned at 7:30 it wasn't there,,,,
3307946,50012817,so I called down to the front desk and was told that they didn't have my clothes and I should call the dry cleaner.,,,,
3307946,50012818,"When I explained that she's the one who should call the dry cleaner, she hung up on me.",,,,
3307946,50012819,"After 3 unanswered calls to the front desk, she finally answered to tell me my clothes never went to the dry cleaner and they were at the front desk.",,,,
3307946,50012820,"When I was asked for an explanation as to why this happened, she told me that she would have to get back to me and hung up.",,,,
3307946,50012821,She never called me back and 5 calls to the front desk went unanswered before I had to go down to the front desk myself.,,,,
3307946,50012822,"At the front desk i was handed my clothes and offered no apology or explanation, in fact the front desk manager said absolutely nothing.",,,,
3307946,50012823,How do people like this get jobs in the hospitality business and how does Holiday Inn/IHG let them slip through the cracks?,,,,

3190697,50012830,Location is horrible ---SEP---,,80009970,Thank you for taking the time to give us some feedback regarding your stay.,
3190697,50012831,We're here in Denver to attend a conference.,,80009971,I am sorry you were disappointed with our location.,
3190697,50012832,Downtown Denver is pricey so we stayed here for a more reasonable price.,,80009972,We are located in an industrial area right off the highway.,
3190697,50012833,"Long story short, pay the extra to stay elsewhere.",,80009973,"While it is not convenient for walking we are just 10-15 minutes from so many great places in Denver including Coors Field, Pepsi Center, Elitch Gardens, National Western Complex, Union Station and many more.",
3190697,50012834,This hotel is near NOTHING.,80009971; 80009973,80009974,"Compared to Downtown Denver's high hotel and parking prices, we are a great value.",
3190697,50012835,U can't walk to anything.,80009971; 80009973,80009975,We do offer our shuttle for guests that do not have a car.,

3190697,50012839,They also have a pool here.,,,,
3190697,50012840,"Aaaand, that's about it.",,,,
3190697,50012841,"If you're looking to find a reasonably priced hotel, search for hotels about 20 mins outside of the city but located in populated areas so that you have somewhere to eat or possibly shop.",,,,
3190697,50012842,Closest place to buy beer is a 20 min walk away.,,,,
3190697,50012843,"Having said all this, if you're driving here, these may not be as much of an issue, but for anyone flying here without a vehicle, definitely choose a different location.",,,,

3299731,50012858,"The pleasant breakfast room always had fresh coffee, teas, and fruit, so when we weren't out on the town, our group enjoyed using it for cards and conversation.",,,,
3299731,50012859,"During our stay our rental car malfunctioned, and the staff pitched in with tools to try to fix the problem; when that didn't work, the staff pulled strings to expedite a replacement vehicle nearby.",80009981,,,

3275265,50012931,---SEP---,,80010041,I'm very glad we were able to accommodate your dog on your family trip and I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the location and decor of the hotel and the breakfast on offer.,
3275265,50012932,"I really recommend it as a hotel that allows dog, that was our priority, to find a nice mid-high range hotel that would allow dogs, and for that reason it fitted the bill.",,80010042,I'm very saddened to hear that you did not receive the high level of service from some of our staff that we usually pride ourselves on.,
3275265,50012933,"Our priority for this family trip was to bring our dog so we searched high and low for a hotel that allowed dogs, most of them were fully booked but luckily Abbey Hotel still had 2 rooms available.",80010041,80010043,I can only apologise; your issues have been raised and we will look to ensure that incidents like these do not happen again.,
3275265,50012934,The dogs are not allowed to stay on the top floor so if you bring a dog you will be given either a basement room or on 2nd and 3rd floor.,,80010044,I'm also sorry to hear that you lost sleep due to noise during your visit.,
3275265,50012935,"UNFRIENDLY FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF So apart from a staff member called Luke who assisted us with dog-friendly recommendations, most of the staff were pretty unfriendly.",80010042,80010045,We hope that you will come back and visit us again in the future and we hope to provide you with our usual better level of service next time.,
3275265,50012936,As you walked passed the reception they would be occupied amongst themselves and not really acknowledge you.,80010042,80010046,"Kind regards, Andrew Foulkes, General Manager",
3275265,50012937,When you did go up to ask a question they were quite blase about answering.,80010042,,,
3275265,50012938,They were generally fine but just don't expect 4-5* service from them.,80010042,,,
3275265,50012939,The least friendly and most abrasive was probably the female restaurant manager.,80010042,,,
3275265,50012940,"It wasn't quite the tone or attitude I would expect of someone manager a hotel restaurant, especially one that is popular like this one.",80010042,,,
3275265,50012941,DON'T FORGET EARPLUGS,,,,
3275265,50012942,"This is a hard one, it's just unfortunate that the building is very old (although nicely renovated and decorated), so you hear EVERY SINGLE footstep.",,,,
3275265,50012943,"Now we took 2 rooms, one on the top floor and one in the basement, and we all lost sleep due to the noises of people running up and down the stairs, walking through the hotel and through the lobby...",80010044,,,
3275265,50012944,This was quite a let down for us because apart from that the hotel is very well decorated.,,,,
3275265,50012945,Just be prepared with your earplugs I'd say.,,,,
3275265,50012946,The breakfast is quite worth getting it's £15 for a hot breakfast (I took the delicious full English breakfast),,,,
3275265,50012947,"and then there is the buffet with the usual suspects (croissants, fruit juice, fruit, yoghurt, ham, cheese).",,,,

3261537,50013061,---SEP---,,80010151,"It was myself who came and checked the room after you advised there was a smoke smell, and I could smell it very faintly.",
3261537,50013062,We reserved a room with a crib as we had a baby with us.,,80010152,Most likely it had come in through the open window from someone smoking in the car parking area.,
3261537,50013063,First room we checked into smelled horribly of smoke.,80010151; 80010152,80010153,"The new room we gave you was just down the hall from the original, backing onto the car parking area once more (not an alley).",
3261537,50013064,We were then given a room at the back alley.,80010153,80010154,"In regards to the ramp, these are in place so that the housekeepers can navigate their supplies sufficiently through the hotel.",
3261537,50013065,We tried a third roomon the second floor.,,80010155,"These are easily pulled up and fastened against the wall, so that guests can safely proceed up and down the small flights of stairs.",
3261537,50013066,"Unlike other places we have stayed, the crib was not set up for us.",,80010156,"The ramps should always be in the upright position once housekeeping has finished for the day, so our sincere apologies for the issue you experienced with this.",
3261537,50013067,We had to go up a VERY steep makeshift platform to get to our room.,80010154; 80010155; 80010156,80010157,We are now looking at taking these out and changing our procedures for the housekeepers.,
3261537,50013068,"With a stroller,it was very dangerous because it was so steep.",,80010158,"Once again, we're very sorry for the issues you experienced, and hope you may give us another chance if you're ever visiting Banff in the future.",
3261537,50013069,NOT safe at all & should not be allowed.,,80010159,"Warm Regards, Laura Preston Front Office Manager",
3261537,50013070,We lost control of the stroller on the way down!,,,,
3261537,50013071,Its a good thing the baby was not in it!!!We were very disappointed and wanted to get out to enjoy Banff so did not complain but certainly will not be going back.,,,,
