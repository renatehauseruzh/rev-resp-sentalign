3287424	50000000	Beautiful views and convenient location ---SEP--- Our family of 4 had a lovely one-night stay.		80000000	Dear ClaireJourneys, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Balgownie Estate.	
3287424	50000001	We stayed in a 2BR unit which had stunning views of the valley.		80000001	It is great to see that you were able to enjoy a family getaway with us at the Estate.	
3287424	50000002	It was quite spacious and comfortable.		80000002	We are working towards renovating all our rooms at the Estate to keep them fresh and appealing for all guests during their stay.	
3287424	50000003	I will add that the d√©cor seemed a bit worn.		80000003	I have also passed your kind words on to our Rae's Restaurant after you enjoyed your meal with us.	
3287424	50000004	We had a very pleasant check-in and were impressed by the woman at reception who was managing two surly guests with grace while we waited.		80000004	We hope to welcome you and your family back for another visit soon.	
3287424	50000005	The complaints we heard were ridiculous and she was so composed.		80000005	Kind Regards Charlotte	
3287424	50000006	She checked us in quickly and in a friendly manner.				
3287424	50000007	We enjoyed a the walking trail around the property and our teen girls liked the giant chess game on the lawn.				
3287424	50000008	We had dinner at Rae's, which was delicious and allowed for an incredible view as well.				
3287424	50000009	The estate is well located near wineries and the chocolatier and was a easy drive to our early balloon flight.				

3173251	50000010	Very good hotel ---SEP--- Stayed here for work for one night.		80000016	Hello KatMcP	
3173251	50000011	Staff were extremely friendly, greeting me as I got out of the lift (reception is on 1st floor) and asking lots of genuine questions about why I was there and how they could help.		80000017	Firstly, great to hear your room was super clean, ill let the housekeeping team and Klaudia know( they probably read this as they all do) Some of our rooms are a bit of a weird shape its true, this is due to the nature of the building and as such we have tried to make the most of natural light and the space itself.	
3173251	50000012	Room was possibly the cleanest I have ever stayed in, but didn't' appear to have a window until I found it hidden behind a wardrobe in the small alcove at the back right of the room.		80000018	We are a square building	
3173251	50000013	Even then it only overlooked a small light well about 12 foot wide but which was so tall I couldn't actually see sky/the weather at the top!		80000019	"so yes, some rooms look onto others, these internal rooms are the favourites of the ""in the know"" guests who like a deep sleep as they are silent."	
3173251	50000014	Weirder still you look straight into other rooms which made me close the curtains to my room despite it only being mid afternoon, so there was essentially no window in the room.		80000020	You can always draw the net curtain for privacy while still allowing for natural light.	
3173251	50000015	This is my only criticism, and a fairly minor one at that.		80000021	Sounds like everything else was peachy though.	
3173251	50000016	Decor is quirky but functional and the free breakfast is plentiful and tasty.		80000022	God times.	
3173251	50000017	Location is excellent, just a few minutes from both main train stations and a few steps from the shopping and most main areas.		80000023	My best Rory	
3173251	50000018	I had a good nights sleep and really appreciated the USB socket next to the.bed for phone chargers!				

3190331	50000020	Fabulous****** ---SEP---		80000034	Hi Jo Great to hear your stay	
3190331	50000021	What an excellent experience.		80000035	we us was a great experience, that lets us know we are going in wright direction.	
3190331	50000022	Really comfortable clean rooms, very affordable, great location, very friendly staff.		80000036	Cleanliness and making our guest as comfortable as possible is what we love to here Thank you Jenny and Tony	
3190331	50000023	Its a credit to Tony and Jenny (Owners) they could not do enough for us.				
3190331	50000024	Great idea supplying crockery and cutlery in the rooms, I spoke to the staff that we only needed towels and not to clean the room, came back and the room was spick and span, I would highly recommend this Motor Inn to anyone Well Done!!!!				

3161232	50000030	Comfortable Three night stay ---SEP---		80000047	WOW, sounds like we ticked all the boxes!	
3161232	50000031	While the hotel could do with some modernising and re-furnishing, the service and customer management is excellent.		80000048	We are glad you had a fabulous time, and look forward to hosting you again soon.	
3161232	50000032	At check in it was noticed that we weren't on the same floor as our friends and this was resolved with ease and no request from ourselves.				
3161232	50000033	The same service and efficient/ effective management was provided when we had an issue with our room and a new room was promptly provided.				
3161232	50000034	Great location, great staff & access to everyday amenities.				
3161232	50000035	Worth getting a pool access room!				
3161232	50000036	Nice views of marina and excellent value.				

3271710	50000040	Fabulous location ---SEP---		80000059	Thank you for taking time to provide feedback on your recent stay.	
3271710	50000041	I really enjoyed this hotel.		80000060	It is pleasing to hear that you really enjoyed your stay with us, along with our unbeatable location with Narrabeen Beach on one side and Narrabeen Lake on the other.	
3271710	50000042	It was a surprising find at the end of a very busy and long day.		80000061	Furthermore, it is great to hear you had a great nights sleep in our comfortable beds, and found our team to be friendly and helpful.	
3271710	50000043	Great surrounds - lake on one side, a beach on the other, with friendly and helpful staff.		80000062	We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back again in the future.	
3271710	50000044	The bed was so comfortable too!		80000063	Kind regards, Anita Reskov Front Office & Reservations Manager Quality Hotel Sands	

3319214	50000050	Poor service ---SEP---		80000074	Dear JaneyJane I am sorry to hear that we did not get the service right during your stay and I will discuss your feedback with the team.	
3319214	50000051	A contemporary hotel with great rooms which was unfortunately let down by very slow service both at dinner and breakfast on the two nights we stayed.		80000075	We want to considered great in everything we do.	
3319214	50000052	We had to request toast 3 times one morning and when it eventually came it was without butter!		80000076	Best wishes Lynn	
3319214	50000053	They appeared to not want to serve more than 1 glass of fruit juice per person either.				
3319214	50000054	On Saturday evening it was busy so we expected a wait				
3319214	50000055	but it was about an hour each between the starter, main and dessert and even then they forgot the extras we had ordered.				
3319214	50000056	Sunday night was much quieter but alas we still had the same problems.				
3319214	50000057	The food when it eventually came was very good.				
3319214	50000058	We ordered cocktails but they had run out of cocktail glasses in which to serve them in.				
3319214	50000059	Not quite the same having a cosmopolitan served in a brandy glass!				
3319214	50000060	The staff appeared to lack training on what constitutes good customer service.				
3319214	50000061	Housekeeping brilliant, as was reception.				
3319214	50000062	The hotel has the potential to be a great hotel but just needs to address the restaurant problems and get the basics				
3319214	50000063	right				

3303988	50000070	Excellent hotel stay in-		80000087	Thank you, JM W. You point out a very important tip when it comes to booking and we thank you for your thoughtful feedback.	
3303988	50000071	well positioned and good service ---SEP---		80000088	We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our central location, Empire views and breakfast at fabrick.	
3303988	50000072	Staying with family during a full week.		80000089	We hope to see you at Archer the next time you are in New York.	
3303988	50000073	The hotel is very well positioned if you want to visit New York - near time square and all the metro, but not with the noise of the street.		80000090	In Hospitality, Michele Mangino - General Manager	
3303988	50000074	"You should take ""empire rooms"" which are a bit more expensive, but with direct view on Empire State Building."				
3303988	50000075	Price is acceptable (lower than all others hotels around with similar quality).				
3303988	50000076	If you stay long, the hotel offers a discount ( nice when staying for a week or more visit).				
3303988	50000077	To have this discount, I recommend you book directly on the web site of the hotel (not with agencies which do not give you the discount)				
3303988	50000078	Good restaurant in the hotel for breakfast.				
3303988	50000079	Good bar at the 22nd floor (but not with your child, as they are not allowed if they are below 21 - NYC law)				
3303988	50000080	"A bit too ""hype"" during the week, so not recommending the restaurant for dinner as overcrowded and noisy and not available without reservation."				

3247010	50000090	Amazing location ---SEP---		80000101	Dear Thiago A, What a wonderful review!	
3247010	50000091	The hotel is really well located in the city center, 10 minutes walking from all major attractions and right in the end of high street.		80000102	I am thrilled to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again in the very near future.	
3247010	50000092	Also really close to the train/bus station, like 8 minutes walking.		80000103	It is reviews like this which shows that all of our hard work does not go unnoticed.	
3247010	50000093	We had a great customer service at the bar (Jonathan was great and really friendly).		80000104	I will be sure to pass your comments on to all of the team, especially Sandra & Jonathan who I know will be so pleased.	
3247010	50000094	In the reception Sandra was very polite and helpful with city tips and all...		80000105	Kind Regards, Conor Flynn Operations Manager	
3247010	50000095	Food is really well served - portions were surprisingly big.				
3247010	50000096	The room followed the Jury's standard (really comfortable and cozy).				

3161840	50000100	On Way to Excellence ---SEP---		80000116	Dear Jim H, Thanks for your review, and feedback after your recent stay.	
3161840	50000101	In midst of renovations, but really did not hear much or was disturbed.		80000117	We are happy to know you enjoyed your stay, and that our renovations at the hotel did not disturb you at all!	
3161840	50000102	Would love it if the M Lounge remained on first floor - ideal location!		80000118	We do apologize for the missteps with the housekeeping department, and appreciate your comments.	
3161840	50000103	Concern has to do with F&B and housekeeping.		80000119	We do our best to extend the Marriott standards, and quality our guests have come to expect, and have taken note of your feedback for our team to review.	
3161840	50000104	Food service items remained in hall for DAYS!		80000120	We appreciate your review, and hope you will return to enjoy all of the new renovations being done at the hotel!	
3161840	50000105	Housekeeping carts blocked movement in hallway - why can't Marriott be cutting edge and develop or adopt Asian hidden housekeeping?				
3161840	50000106	Finally, it seems as though if the hotel strategically places tip envelopes for housekeeping staff why not for other employees?				

3260044	50000110	5 star luxury and service.		80000131	Mahalo for staying with us at Trump Waikiki during your most recent trip to Honolulu and further commenting on your vacation with us!	
3260044	50000111	---SEP---		80000132	We are very delighted to hear that we were able to live up to your expectations.	
3260044	50000112	While getting a special deal through Tripit.com it still is a financially high end place to stay, but worth every $.				
3260044	50000113	Excellent gym, pool and hot tub are are outdoors and have a beautiful view of the beach.				
3260044	50000114	The rooms we stayed in were amazing.				
3260044	50000115	The service the best i've ever experienced anywhere in the world.				

3267976	50000120	Very romantic ---SEP---		80000143	Dear Chloedoubtfire1950, Thank you for your first class review following your visit to Cardiff.	
3267976	50000121	I was spoilt by my husband to spend the weekend in our own city at the Hilton hotel and I must say it was a luxury weekend feeling spoilt with VIP treatment, the staff were very accommodating to all our requests and went the extra mile to make sure we wanted for nothing thank you !		80000144	Your comments are very encouraging and an absolute pleasure to read.	
3267976				80000145	I will most certainly pass on your praise and gratitude to our team at the hotel, where no doubt they will further be inspired by your kind comments.	
3267976				80000146	Thank you for taking the time to offer great feedback.	
3267976				80000147	I do hope that we will have the opportunity of welcoming you back to the Hilton Cardiff once again in the near future.	
3267976				80000148	Kind regards Marie Fagan General Manager	

3240369	50000130	Close to everything.		80000159	Clean, comfortable and friendly is what we aim for.	
3240369	50000131	Easy, available power for electric cars.		80000160	The motel has a great location and I maybe bias	
3240369	50000132	---SEP--- Motel just on the edge of the main shopping strip.		80000161	but I still think we are the best valued motel in town.	
3240369	50000133	Rooms away from the street.				
3240369	50000134	Close to shops and attractions.				
3240369	50000135	Friendly staff.				
3240369	50000136	Available power for an electric car.

3178303	50000151	You get what you pay for..		80000173	Im really happy to see that you found your room to have clean and spacious and the reception team to have been understanding and polite.	
3178303	50000152	The price is average for this hotel however, I feel like the swimming pool area needs a good clean and the changing room for the gym was appalling..		80000174	We are always working on ways to improve our gym and pool facilities , and of course will continue to do so in the future.	
3178303	50000153	I have seen better changing rooms in public swimming pools..		80000175	We hope to see you back again soon.	
3178303	50000154	We booked a family room with 1 double bed, 1 single bed and 1 sofa bed but we got 1 double bed and 2 sofa beds which wasn't a big issue.				
3178303	50000155	Check in was slightly earlier as there was a room available and the lady at the reception was very understanding and polite.				
3178303	50000156	The rooms were clean and spacious..				
3178303	50000157	The hotel is slightly old and damp but you get what you pay for.

3256452	50000165	It's not the cheapest, but it is amazing value.				
3256452	50000166	You leave with happy memories.

3320567	50000173	The free breakfast was very good with a full selection of cereals, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, fruit, juices, breads.....				
3320567	50000174	And they had yogurt which most hotels don't!				

3231479	50000180	WOW.		80000212	We are so pleased that you had such a pleasant experience staying at our park, Jasmine!	
3231479	50000181	---SEP---		80000213	Thank you kindly for your review and we look forward to having you with us again.	
3231479	50000182	We stayed at Discovery Parks - Dubbo for 2 nights as we visited Dubbo for a Zoo visit.				
3231479	50000183	When I read the Park was close to the Zoo I didn‚Äôt realise it was literally a one minute drive, it was perfect.				
3231479	50000184	When we arrived to our deluxe 2 bedroom cabin we were blown away by the standard.				
3231479	50000185	Clean to an absolute high standard, bedding fresh and clean and great size.

3231479	50000189	We will no doubt be definitely staying here again.				
3231479	50000190	5 stars without a doubt.

3178561	50000220	Excellent service.		80000254	Dear Nancy R S, Thank you so much for taking the time to write us about your recent stay at Loews Chicago Hotel.	
3178561	50000221	---SEP--- Classy and friendly.		80000255	I am thrilled to hear about your five star worthy experience with us.	
3178561	50000222	Rooms terrific.		80000256	I appreciate your wonderful comments about our friendly team, location, and our outdoor restaurant, Streeterville Social.	
3178561	50000223	Business center very well stocked with supplies.		80000257	We know you have many options to choose from and we thank you for choosing Loews Chicago.	
3178561	50000224	Near the spot to pick up river cruise/tour groups.		80000258	We look forward to seeing you again very soon.

3178561	50000226	It is about a 2mile walk to the Chicago History Museum and about a 20 walk to the Loop.				
3178561	50000227	It is more expensive than other near by hotels..but I found it to be worth it.				

3319899	50000230	Great family getaway ---SEP---		80000260	Hi Nicole and you‚Äôve made our day by giving us a 5 star review ‚Äì thank you!	
3319899	50000231	Very friendly and helpful staff, always saw someone around cleaning.. so much for the children to do without leaving the park, very clean and tidy.. accommodation and public kitchen area clean and tidy (after staff had cleaned up after some disrespectful people) not to far out of town but far enough to feel secluded üòÜ		80000261	Your comments are a pleasure to read and we look forward to having the pleasure of welcoming you and your family back again for another getaway.	

3271804	50000240	So many positives ---SEP---		80000272	Hell akaciczo, Just wanted to message you back to say a big thank you from the team here at the Clayton Hotel Burlington Road for the lovely comments and the excellent score you have awarded us.	
3271804	50000241	Shower in our suite had a slow drain so you risked a flood if you were in longer than 5 minutes.		80000273	Really hope to see you again soon and the team would be delighted to welcome you back.	
3271804	50000242	Suite also had a bathtub with a separate shower head, so the shower flooding was irrelevant.		80000274	Again, thank you so much for the time and custom you gave us as it is very much appreciated.	
3271804	50000243	Bed was huge and extremely comfortable but they did not provide us with extra blankets which would have helped when we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to use the remote controlled heater.		80000275	Kind Regards Daniel O' Connor Customer Service Manager	
3271804	50000244	Plates are as hot as lava at the breakfast buffet, but the food selection was vast and absolutely delicious - great way to start the day.				
3271804	50000245	Business center offers a free printer so you can print your boarding pass before leaving, just make sure it‚Äôs set to print to the correct printer.				
3271804	50000246	The gym was the largest and most equipped of all hotel gyms I‚Äôve ever seen, but you may get locked in if you don‚Äôt know how the doors work (yeah this is a thing).				
3271804	50000247	There‚Äôs also a great view from the gym.				
3271804	50000248	Elevators were extremely quick.				
3271804	50000249	Bar is huge, but service for cocktails or mixed drinks can be a bit slow.				
3271804	50000250	While you can order room service at any hour, it would be great if there were snack machines available for a late night fix as the closest convenience store is a 15 minute walk.				
3271804	50000251	Taxi queue is right outside and they are always available, so is the bus stop.				
3271804	50000252	Walk to town is 15-20 minutes.				
3271804	50000253	Quiet rooms and neighborhood.

3253514	50000301	The hotel is nice and well situated on the side of the mountain with great views.		80000342	We are pleased to hear you were able to enjoy the magnificent views of the Rocky Mountains.	
3253514	50000302	However, the traffic on Mountain Avenue dead ends just above the hotel at the hot springs and gondola.		80000343	Remember to book direct to take advantage of our Best Rate Guarantee Program and best in class service!	
3253514	50000303	When we were there, the road gridlocked around 5:00 pm and was impassable without a 1 1/2 hour car wait until well after 8 pm.		80000344	In Hospitality, Rimrock Resort Hotel Management	
3253514	50000304	We were forced to walk to town and back for dinner.				
3253514	50000305	No taxis would come to the area for hear of getting stuck in the gridlock.

3296386	50000314	Good reverse cycle aircon.				
3296386	50000315	Great pressure in shower and very hot water.				
3296386	50000316	As noted doona covers probably need a wash.				
3296386	50000317	Other than that a good place to stay

3167339	50000351	The Coconut Waikiki is a comfortable hotel conveniently located within about 15 minutes walk from Waikiki beach.		80000401	Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.	
3167339	50000352	The staff were all genuinely very friendly and helpful.		80000402	We're happy you enjoyed your stay with us and it sounds like you were able to take advantage of the best our hotel has to offer; the Coconut Waikiki's location right in the middle of Waikiki and the continental breakfast served in the mornings.	
3167339	50000353	The room was modern and spacious with lots of storage.		80000403	The next time you're looking to book a hotel in Waikiki, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!	
3167339	50000354	The bathroom was a little cosy and the air-conditioning was quite noisy.		80000404	Mahalo	
3167339	50000355	The self service continental breakfast (included in the room rate) was excellent with plenty of choice.				
3167339	50000356	"Unfortunately, the maid service didn't seem to know about the hotel's ""help us conserve"" programme so the towels were changed daily, even though we had hung them up as requested."				
3167339	50000357	Our only significant gripe was the car parking - $30/night was excessive.				
3167339	50000358	Excellent WiFi in the room.

3285747	50000387	thanks to doug and kenny for making my stay as pleasant and enjoyable as ever!				

3250583	50000390	West restaurant fantastic, hotel tired and taken over by locals ---SEP---		80000456	Dear Labella1, Once again, thank you for your visit and thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience.	
3250583	50000391	My partner booked two nights for our anniversary and I was really looking forward to it having read all the reviews and looked at pics.		80000457	I am delighted to see you had high expectations prior to your arrival due to the research you did on third party review sites such as Trip Advisor.	
3250583	50000392	We had a suite with a bar in it		80000458	The overwhelming comments on these sites by guests who have stayed at The Twelve are namely about::- 1) how wonderful the staff are, 2) how great their dining experiences were, 3) how wonderul the atmosphere is and 4) how true the Twelve's website is to actual reality.	
3250583	50000393	but it was structure only, had a microwave but no cutlery or plates and mini bar had no red or white wine, but for a ‚Ç¨5 euro service charge they brought some wine.		80000459	You can therefore understand my disappointment when we did not live up to your expectations on the latter two.	
3250583	50000394	On arrival there was a drill on one of the tables apparently someone was putting a hook on bathroom door.		80000460	The Twelve is very much unlike the vast majority of hotels and this is why it is so well liked.	
3250583	50000395	Went for a drink in the Pins Bar to get over our long trip and providing there is no one in the bar you can get table service.		80000461	Our local bar atmosphere is an integral part of our successful formula and it is something we shout about proudly on our website.	
3250583	50000396	Thankfully and the one thing that saved our break was the West restaurant where the food is without reservation some of the best I have ever tasted, and the wine selection amazing, would go back for the food but would probably stay elsewhere it was ‚Ç¨199 per night that did include breakfast and our meal in The West (no wine).		80000462	It is this beautiful buzz which helps make The Twelve what it is.	
3250583	50000397	I had read that they had jazz in The Pins but sadly not anymore.		80000463	Along with our staff and perfect location, the other wonderful elements are our devotion to great food and wine.	
3250583	50000398	On second day we went for a drive to explore had a lovely day but when we came back football was on and no seats in The Pins and no residents bar.		80000464	I am delighted to see you had a terrific experience in West.	
3250583	50000399	I cannot honestly say it was a complete washout		80000465	We have been greatly honoured with numerous accolades for West's cuisine as well as our wine list which has won pretty much every wine award there is to win.	
3250583	50000400	but it was also not what they bill it as on their site, so by all means go, worth it for food alone but don't bother with the overpriced suites, we spent no time in the extra space as there was nothing in it.		80000466	We do feature free live entertainment every weekend.	
3250583	50000401	I presume that the reason we had no bath in the room was because we had the bar not worth it.		80000467	On Fridays, it is always Traditional Irish music sessions - really good sessions.	
3250583				80000468	Saturdays, however lend thmselves to more variety.	
3250583				80000469	Sometimes it is Jazz, other times it is Blues.	
3250583				80000470	We always try to mix it up and the reason for this is based upon feedback from our guests.	
3250583				80000471	Our Facebook page always has the most up to the minute infomation.	
3250583				80000472	There are two end suites in the hotel which were designed for guests who want walk in showers rather than a bath.	
3250583				80000473	When you book directly on The Twelve's official website, you are given the luxury of choice.	
3250583				80000474	Unfortunately, this is not possible on third party sites.	
3250583				80000475	Labella, I really wish you had given us the opportunity to make some sort of service recovery whilst you were staying with us.	
3250583				80000476	Our goal is to ensure every guest has a wonderful time at The Twelve.	
3250583				80000477	Sincerely, Fergus	

3316416	50000410	Funky hostel/hotel in a beautiful setting ---SEP---		80000488	"""I am not sure if you were aware of our sign on the front desk that indicates how to get a hold of us."	
3316416	50000411	We had a room with 2 twin beds.		80000489	We cannot be at the front desk all the time, but we are always happy to give information about the area.	
3316416	50000412	There was a sink in the room with the beds and a bathroom.		80000490	"Thanks for the time to write a review."""	
3316416	50000413	Showers were in the hallway.				
3316416	50000414	They provided bathrobes and the showers were very clean.				
3316416	50000415	We had to ask for extra pillows as the pillows were not very fluffy.				
3316416	50000416	The girl gave us the last 2 pillows.				
3316416	50000417	The breakfast was very basic and you had to wash your own dishes--hostel style.				
3316416	50000418	The man who checked us in was not friendly and seemed distressed when I asked him for 2 keys.				
3316416	50000419	No one was ever at the front desk so I never was able to get advice about the local activities and amenities.				
3316416	50000420	The common area was very nice with couches, tables in a colorful, sunny room.				
3316416	50000421	The Cube is an easy walk from everything in Revelstoke.				

3299332	50000430	Moving Daughter ---SEP--- Great Motel clean and very comfortable spacious rooms Hotel was also great very friendly and helpful staff Would highly recommend this Motel.		80000501	Thank so much for a lovely review, we appreciate the kind words greatly.	
3299332	50000431	Good location easy to get to rooms are nice and quiet.		80000502	Enjoy your travels and we hope to see you again soon.	
3299332	50000432	Breakfast available to rooms.		80000503	Kind regards, Sandy L.	

3190936	50000440	Disappointing.		80000514	Dear Reviewer, Thank you for taking the time to leave your review, I am sorry that we did not exceed your expectations during your recent visit.	
3190936	50000441	Would not stay again ---SEP---		80000515	To enable us to be the best at what we do, we take customer feedback and points very seriously however we would like to inform you that the old part of this Hotel a Victorian building is due to have refurbishments in the future and had you voiced your disatifaction on arrival with the room you booked we would have endeavoured subject to availability, to upgrade you to our recently refurbished rooms.	
3190936	50000442	This hotel obviously has some lovely refurbished rooms.		80000516	Very many thanks General Mangement Response Team	
3190936	50000443	Mine was not one of them.				
3190936	50000444	A tired, dated room with a squeaky bed that was medium-comfortable.				
3190936	50000445	The walls were full of holes from old fittings, the furniture had seen better days and the bathroom was also in need of a refurbish.				
3190936	50000446	Stupid wee things - the toilet roll holder hung off the wall and it fell on the floor all the time.				
3190936	50000447	None of these things matter when you're asleep so a good night's sleep would have made me less critical.				
3190936	50000448	My room was at the back of the hotel and quiet on the first night (bank holiday).				
3190936	50000449	On the second n get there was someone in the room above me and next to me.				
3190936	50000450	You could hear every footstep and the floorboards sounded like they were ready to collapse.				
3190936	50000451	Every person going upstairs sounded like they were stomping in my room.				
3190936	50000452	Being near reception there were voices every time someone came in.				
3190936	50000453	The heating/cooling unit made a buzzing noise for a few seconds every ten mins waking up a light sleeper.				
3190936	50000454	The glass and bottle brought from the 'bar' (small fridge at reception)				
3190936	50000455	was not cleared out of my room after the first day.				
3190936	50000456	Staff were pleasant and I was asked on departure if they could do anything to help after I complained about noise.				
3190936	50000457	Short of new floorboards nothing could help after the event.				
3190936	50000458	Breakfast ok. Staff not identified with either uniforms or badges.				
3190936	50000459	Won't be back.				
3190936	50000460	From the reviews there are obviously some nice rooms - perhaps on top floor wth				
3190936	50000461	nobody above.				
3190936	50000462	My stay was very disappointing.				

3275888	50000470	Friendly, modern and central ---SEP---		80000527	Hey moonmobile What can i say??

3275888	50000475	I also liked the relaxed bar/dining room/reception area.				
3275888	50000476	Really helpful and hospitable staff, with a special thank you to Alix.				
3275888	50000477	Just the right place to land after a long flight from Australia.				
3275888	50000478	Highly recommended.

3314622	50000497	The breakfast, well the breakfast was very minimal at best.				
3314622	50000498	It was fresh and edible but that is about it.				
3314622	50000499	It seems to me they need to focus on the small details.				
3314622	50000500	Overall we were satisfied and would stay here again

3262437	50000512	Perched between two beaches that are only 4 minutes walk maximum on flat pathway.		80000575	It is very rewarding when we exceed guest expectations !	
3262437	50000513	Nelsons Bay shopping centre a three minute drive or 15 min walk.		80000576	We do agree .....	
3262437	50000514	On the way you will pass the Diggers club where the meals were excellent for the price.		80000577	our location is superb and we do take pride ion the cleanliness of our apartments.

3238614	50000520	Loved the quiet ---SEP---		80000589	Thank you Elaine for taking the time to review your stay with us at Eagle's Nest Condo Resort.	
3238614	50000521	A bit of a drive if you're planning to do much in Branson itself.		80000590	We are glad to learn that you had a wonderful time and hope you will visit us again soon!	
3238614	50000522	As Michigan natives, we aren't used to the winding roads and hills of the Ozarks.				
3238614	50000523	Glad we had our brakes taken care of before we went on this trip!				
3238614	50000524	But the view from the balcony was wonderful.				
3238614	50000525	The kitchen and laundry area were compact but had everything necessary so we could fix breakfast and lunch and even have some friends over.				

3326975	50000530	Large rooms and good breakfast ---SEP---		80000601	Thanks for the great review and feedback.	
3326975	50000531	We had two rooms that they conveniently put next to each other.		80000602	We are so happy to hear you had a great stay and look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

3295796	50000540	Dated Room - Service was Spotty ---SEP---		80000613	Dear PaulusHookJC, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Hilton Glasgow.	
3295796	50000541	Positives: - Women at front desk were expedient and friendly.		80000614	While I am happy to hear your feedback on the friendly service from our front desk team, nice view from your room and delicious scallop starter, I am sorry to read there were some areas mentioned in your review that prevented you from having an overall positive experience with us.	
3295796	50000542	-		80000615	As with all Tripadvisor reviews your comments have been shared with our team, in particular, our Food and Beverage Manager.	
3295796	50000543	My room was on the 15th floor and had a nice view.		80000616	Your feedback will be included as part of our on-going review of products and services we offer our guests.	
3295796	50000544	-		80000617	All forms of feedback are invaluable in ensuring we maintain our high level of service and standards and I do hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back to the hotel in the near future.	
3295796	50000545	My scallop starter at dinner was very delicious.		80000618	Kind Regards, Lisa	
3295796	50000546	-Good water pressure and large towels in shower.				
3295796	50000547	- Taxis were always available out front.				
3295796	50000548	Negatives: - Room was not updated and felt like an old Holiday Inn.				
3295796	50000549	Looked nothing like website photos.				
3295796	50000550	-				
3295796	50000551	The wifi situation SUCKS.				
3295796	50000552	"There is ""free"" temporary wifi in rooms but I couldn't get a signal."				
3295796	50000553	I tried to pay repeatedly for the actual wifi and was unable.				
3295796	50000554	A 5-star hotel must include superior wifi service in all rooms.				
3295796	50000555	-				
3295796	50000556	The coffee bar took three people and 15 minutes to make a latte and topped it with cocoa powder?				
3295796	50000557	-				
3295796	50000558	While my starter and the bread/butter at dinner were very good, the service was terrible (he'd disappear for ages) and the Salmon main was undercooked and bland.				
3295796	50000559	I don't even remember dessert.				
3295796	50000560	And expensive!				
3295796	50000561	- Room service pizza was a fluffy mess.				
3295796	50000562	- I felt, even at $175/night that I overpaid.				

3204632	50000570	Attention to detail and genuine hospitality ---SEP---		80000629	Wow!	
3204632	50000571	Prior to arrival, the owner Chris emailled to check about how we would like the rooms configured and as to dietary requirements etc which was a great start.		80000630	Thank you for this review!	
3204632	50000572	On arrival we were warmly welcomed to a lovely little seperate apartment surrounded by fragrant gardens and in a quiet area of Cambridge.				
3204632	50000573	We appreciated the attention to detail, from the plethora of soft towels in the bathroom, to the wide variety of fresh condiments, to the detailed visitor booklet with information on absolutely everything in the area.				
3204632	50000574	There is a fan and heater to use if required as it has no air con, and a lovely outdoor spa in a private location.				
3204632	50000575	Beds were comfortable; large shower room, flat screen tv and plunger coffee.				
3204632	50000576	Breakfast was freshly baked delicious muffins which were a big hit with everyone (thank you Chris!), a generous supply of bread for toast as well as yoghurt and cereal choices.				
3204632	50000577	Muffins b&b is obviously run by someone who loves what she does and it really shows.				
3204632	50000578	We are international visitors but if back in the area we would not consider staying anywhere else.				

3290679	50000580	Mr ---SEP--- Best to none had a fabulous time at the hotel and the staffs were amazing looked me after all my needs I‚Äôll definitely be back ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è		80000641	Dear Matthew, Thank you for sharing your feedback from your recent stay with us.

3261453	50000591	We recently visited Queenstown and didn't hesitate to return to this lovely little boutique hotel.		80000656	I have to agree with you, Botanic Garden and the Lake side are just stroll from our boutique hotel.	
3261453	50000592	Great location with just a stroll to the Lake Front via Botanic Gardens.		80000657	On behalf of all the Ladies & Gentlemen here, we certainly hope that we will see you again in the future.

3283926	50000610	Bonanza in Bendigo ---SEP---		80000684	Hello Graham A, Thank you for your great feedback.	
3283926	50000611	Much more than just a motel overnighter.		80000685	I am so pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us and the apartment met your expectations.	
3283926	50000612	Spacious facilities quality fittings and kitchen as well.		80000686	We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.	
3283926	50000613	Would suit multiple stay or even the one night.				
3283926	50000614	Just like home!				
3283926	50000615	Plenty of parking, quiet location even on the main road.				

3256745	50000620	Great Hotel, ideal location ---SEP--- Stayed for 10 days Feb-Mar 17, loved this hotel.		80000697	Many thanks for your feedback.	
3256745	50000621	Arrived late at night 10pm, was meet by Ellie who showed us the key safe for our room.		80000698	We look forward to seeing them again.	
3256745	50000622	Great location to beach, used the beach chairs & towels provided.				
3256745	50000623	The room was prefect for us, spotless on arrival, the kitchen enables you to make a light breakfast or lunch, great coffee machine.				
3256745	50000624	We always had hot water in the shower, just let it run for a couple of minutes.				
3256745	50000625	Spent a lot of time on the beach at Lauderdale by the Sea, about 8 miles away.				
3256745	50000626	Didn't hire a car but used the Sun Trolley ($1), Galt Link (free from Galleria Mall) and city bus no. 11 ($2).				
3256745	50000627	The room was serviced each time we left the sign on the doors, usually clean towels, bins emptied etc.				
3256745	50000628	Ellie, Kim & Chris were all really helpful and there is always some-one around from 9am - 5pm or a phone call away.				
3256745	50000629	Have to mention our favourite bar/restaurant Casablanca's, just at 5 minute walk away, great staff, food and music.				
3256745	50000630	Yes, there is construction site opposite but there is so much to do in Fort Lauderdale we didn't spend much time by the pool, construction noise cannot be heard in the room (203).				
3256745	50000631	Kim helped us book the Everglades Air boat Trip, the company picked us up from the hotel and dropped us back, a great day out.				
3256745	50000632	Would definitely go back				

3314297	50000640	Great hotel and location.		80000709	Hi Imwainui, Thanks for the great review!	
3314297	50000641	---SEP---		80000710	We're glad to hear you enjoyed our famous Rydges Dream Beds!	
3314297	50000642	A very enjoyable hotel to stay in all areas.		80000711	Nothing like a good nights sleep after a hard days shopping.	
3314297	50000643	All staff very professional and helpful in their designated duties.		80000712	See you next time in Wellington!	
3314297	50000644	Found the pillows too high the first night so rang reception to request flatter ones which arrived within minutes.		80000713	^Alana P	
3314297	50000645	Beds are divinely comfortable.				
3314297	50000646	Breakfast choices are the best I have come across in a NZ hotel.				
3314297	50000647	Many healthy options also if you wish!				
3314297	50000648	Heated pool and spa was great after a days shopping!				
3314297	50000649	Very central location that is within walking distance to many places of interest.				

3316144	50000650	Fairly priced ---SEP--- Stayed here while working in Holyhead, bed was very comfortable and room was clean.		80000724	Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3316144	50000651	The bathroom was a good size.		80000725	We are so pleased to learn that you were happy with the overall experience and found the staff helpful and friendly and your bed comfortable.	
3316144	50000652	The staff were always happy to help and very polite.		80000726	We strive to give customers an enjoyable stay and we are happy to see that this has been achieved.	
3316144	50000653	Make sure you get there early as parking can be an issue.		80000727	Feedback such as yours is invaluable and we will ensure the hotel receives a copy of your comments.	
3316144	50000654	Close to the town and a McDonald's round the corner		80000728	Thank you once again and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.	

3239864	50000660	Never again ---SEP---		80000739	We regret to hear of your disappointment in our hotel.	
3239864	50000661	Just an average Joe		80000740	We strive to provide all our guest with excellent customer service and value during their stay.	
3239864	50000662	but I know what regular hotels offer		80000741	It is truly unfortunate that your overall impression of our hotel was unsatisfactory.	
3239864	50000663	so I know what my money is worth.		80000742	Price for valued paid is something that we very conscious of and thus have various offering for the budget traveler.	
3239864	50000664	Have to pay for parking but only two floors of garage parking rest is outside parking.		80000743	We hope to have another opportunity to host you in the future in hopes of you experiencing a typical Tampa Airport Marriott stay.	
3239864	50000665	Have to pay to use wifi.				
3239864	50000666	Can ask for a fridge as a free service but can only put in 6 coke cans as the fridge they send you is smaller than my wife purse.				
3239864	50000667	Sliding doors to balcony do not open.				
3239864	50000668	No free breakfast and the prices for the amount of food made me apologize to the hotel for their insult.				
3239864	50000669	Their sandwich was literally regular slices of bread like for toast and some lunch meat and lettuce for 15$. Bottle of water for 5$ not even a 20oz.				
3239864	50000670	Pool was the size of two spas together.				
3239864	50000671	Bed was soft, a/c worked, room was sound proof enough the airplanes were noticeable when taking off but did get use to it but would not recommend to someone who require absolute quiet.				
3239864	50000672	Good quality TV though useless as they only have regular hotel channels.				
3239864	50000673	For the price this place is not even on the list of consideration ever again.				
3239864	50000674	It was like I was waiting for the cameras to jump out and say I been punked.				
3239864	50000675	I did stay the first night out of my 3 night reservation out of pity.				
3239864	50000676	I felt so sorry for this hotel.				
3239864	50000677	After the first night though I had to go get my money's worth and stayed elsewhere and just took the hit for canceling my reservation in the middle of it.				

3232128	50000680	Very disappointed ---SEP---		80000754	Dear Jack, I am very sorry about the issue you had with our hotel during your last stay with us in Regina.	
3232128	50000681	I travel a lot for business and recently had two stays, 8 nights in total at this site.		80000755	We did endure some issues with our Wi-Fi and our business center computers router had to be replaced.	
3232128	50000682	This Ramada would not have been my first choice having been disappointed a few times some years ago.		80000756	Our Wi-Fi was affected by a leak that caused our server to crash.	
3232128	50000683	My most recent stays validated why I don't normally stay there and won't stay there again any time soon.		80000757	We had ordered a replacement a switch was the main hub had water damage after we found it was the faulty one.	
3232128	50000684	The old style room heater rattled so badly you had to choose heat or television and certainly wouldn't have had it on while you were sleeping.		80000758	We have replaced this and we are enjoying industry leading internet service once again.	
3232128	50000685	"Access to internet is essential for me on business and I'd have had better connectivity using pop cans and string then what they refer to as ""high speed"" I gave up and eventually found a local coffee shop for essential internet needs."		80000759	Thank-you once again and all my best Terry Groff General Manager Ramada Plaza Regina terry.groff@saskramada.com 306-569-7476	
3232128	50000686	The business center is a joke, on three occasions I went down to print documents from my thumb drive to find the printer not working, copying on one occasion was also not possible due to the cartridge being empty.				
3232128	50000687	There wasn't so much as a stapler to be found (you might want to see what your competition doing in this area).				
3232128	50000688	The food and overall service was at best mediocre, personally I have no plans to stay there again and would certainly advise colleagues to do the same.				
3232128	50000689	Far better value available.				

3241261	50000690	Spot on just perfect.		80000760	Dear seedooreg, Thank you for taking your time and sharing your recent experience with us at Meriton Serviced Apartments Zetland.	
3241261	50000691	---SEP--- Shopping Centre 2 min walk away to pick up fresh produce to cook your own dinner very handy.		80000761	We were delighted to read that you have enjoyed our apartment and the convenient location.	
3241261	50000692	Was very close to business district of botany.		80000762	We value your kind feedback which will be shared amongst the team.	
3241261	50000693	Audi Centre across the road to check out that new ride!		80000763	Once again, thank you for choosing us and looking forward to see you again shortly.	
3241261	50000694	The apartments themselves were spotless and well appointed.		80000764	Best regards, Shawn Kim Front Office Manager	
3241261	50000695	The furniture was so generous that the bedroom door wouldn't close!				
3241261	50000696	Every convenience that you would want whilst you were away was on hand.				
3241261	50000697	Will definately use again.

3249780	50000705	The heat system is slightly difficult to regulate which tends to cause the rooms to be slightly too warm.				

3250836	50000710	Sheraton Club Staff ---SEP--- First and foremost, Kevin and Erica- the club attends make you feel so comfortable.		80000780	Thank you for taking the time to give us a 5 star review on the Sheraton Tampa Brandon on Tripadvisor.

3184901	50000720	Ideal short stay location ---SEP---		80000794	Thank you for your review.	
3184901	50000721	I was attending a charity event at the racecourse and didn't fancy driving home afterwards.		80000795	I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3184901	50000722	The Adelaide International Motel is a comfortable walking distance away, has plenty of off-road parking and is very reasonably priced.		80000796	My team of housekeeping staff work very hard along with management to make our guests feel comfortable and maintain clean accommodation.	
3184901	50000723	I can't claim to have had the full hotel experience, it was just the one night, I didn't even stay for breakfast (although it did smell tempting).		80000797	I am glad you enjoyed the location and hope next time you stay with us you will enjoyed our cooked breakfast selection.	
3184901	50000724	So, what can I tell you to help you make your decision?		80000798	Kind Regards Jodie	
3184901	50000725	Well, the welcome was warm and genuine and check-in				
3184901	50000726	was quick and efficient.				
3184901	50000727	The room was clean...				
3184901	50000728	no, it was more than just clean, it was spotless.				
3184901	50000729	Maybe the decor was a little dated, but that's not a bad thing - makes it a little different from the standard clone business hotels.				
3184901	50000730	There was even a small swimming pool at the back.				
3184901	50000731	As a base for a trip, it would be pretty good, with easy access to Glenelg in one direction and the city in the other.				
3184901	50000732	It's also close enough to the airport to make it a good pre or post-flight stop.				
3184901	50000733	All-in-all, comfortable, unpretentious and excellent value for money				

3196583	50000740	Piped music ---SEP---		80000809	Dear Geoff E, Thank you for your review.	
3196583	50000741	We went to the Cambridge Hilton.		80000810	I am sorry your experience was not as good as it should have been.	
3196583	50000742	Decided to have a couple of drinks in the bar.		80000811	I have made the Bar team aware of your comments and we will do our best in beating your expectations in the future.	
3196583	50000743	The service was very slow		80000812	I hope we have that pleasure.	
3196583	50000744	BUT the most annoying part of the experience was listening to the piped music.		80000813	Once again, thank you for your feedback.	
3196583	50000745	If you go to the hotel and use the bar I suggest ear plugs are a must				

3288937	50000750	Peppers ---SEP---		80000824	Hello felixandpaulines, Thank you for taking the time to review our property on Tripadvisor.	
3288937	50000751	A beautiful place very relaxing the staff were excellent and the rooms were lovely dinner in the restaurant was very good and so was our breakfast I was a little disappointed with the massage I received was not the full hour		80000825	I am so happy you enjoyed fantastic service and had a great experience in Katers.	
3288937				80000826	I am sorry you were disappointed with the massage, I will pass this feedback on to the spa provider.	
3288937				80000827	Regards, Jesse Kornoff General Manager	

3239629	50000760	Great hotel ---SEP--- Amazing value for money.		80000838	Thanks for a lovely review, we are delighted to hear you and family enjoyed our Dublin Zoo Easter Family Break Offer.

3239629	50000764	Will definitely return.				

3273634	50000770	Ideal Gem ---SEP--- Just excellent in every way & great value.		80000851	Dear Holidayhos, Thank you very much for your amazing review of the Park Grand Kensington.	
3273634	50000771	Perfect location on quiet road for Earl‚Äôs Court tube & easy stroll to Kensington Park.		80000852	It is a great pleasure to read your kind words about our team and our hotel.	
3273634	50000772	All staff were fantastic as well, nothing too much trouble.		80000853	"We really do try to create that ""home away from home"" feeling and I am glad we delivered."	
3273634	50000773	Rooms were immaculate & very well appointed!		80000854	I am absolutely thrilled that you loved our fantastic location and was able to experience Kensington Park .	
3273634				80000855	We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you again in the future.	
3273634				80000856	Best regards, Arpan Ghosh	

3208554	50000780	Overnight stay ---SEP---		80000867	Dear Fonzieaa, Thank you for taking the time to write a review!	
3208554	50000781	Very pleased with everything.		80000868	It is always fantastic to hear what our guests think of our property!	
3208554	50000782	The room was modern and clean.		80000869	I will be sure to pass your thoughts on to the staff, I'm sure they will be very glad to hear it.	
3208554	50000783	The staff was friendly and helpful.		80000870	See you soon!	
3208554	50000784	The price was great too.		80000871	Clayton Kemp General Manager	
3208554	50000785	Very modern facilities!				
3208554	50000786	It has just what we were looking for.				
3208554	50000787	We will be back!!				

3317098	50000790	Great stay and a bargain weekend rate at the Courtyard on Senate Avenue (there are 2 downtown)		80000882	Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Indianapolis at the Capitol and for leaving a review.	
3317098	50000791	---SEP--- Got a $81 AAA weekend rate on the Marriot website.		80000883	I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and felt we were a good value.	
3317098	50000792	This is the lowest I found for this weekend in downtown Indy.		80000884	We look forward to seeing you next time you are in Indianapolis.	
3317098	50000793	The hotel is near the Residence Inn on the Canal.		80000885	Sincerely, Jenny Richter	
3317098	50000794	The staff is very professional and very helpful.				
3317098	50000795	My room had a few issues (toilet handle needed adjusting) which were promptly dealt with.				
3317098	50000796	Laundry room if you need to do laundry (for a dollar-with free detergent).				
3317098	50000797	Free internet in the business center.				
3317098	50000798	Skip the $9 breakfast and grab some yogurt for a dollar.				
3317098	50000799	Near the museums and a short walk to the downtown Circle Center Mall.				
3317098	50000800	Take a walk on the nearby canal.				
3317098	50000801	Skip the $17 parking charge and park on the street (no charge on weekends).				
3317098	50000802	Rooms a little noisy (I could sometimes hear the neighbors).				
3317098	50000803	Overall, highly recommended (Note:				
3317098	50000804	There is a newer Courtyard near the Capitol on Washington--this review is of the older Courtyard on Senate Avenue.				
3317098	50000805	Rate at newer property was much higher).				

3204169	50000810	Love the Outrigger Waikiki!		80000896	Aloha miss76wa.	
3204169	50000811	---SEP---		80000897	Thank you very much for being a loyal return guest of the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort.	
3204169	50000812	This was our third stay at Outrigger in the past 3 years.		80000898	We are delighted that you enjoyed a third fantastic stay with us.	
3204169	50000813	It's fast become a favorite of ours due to the friendly service, great location and fantastic value for money.		80000899	It is always our pleasure to provide friendly local hospitality, relaxing rooms and the best value for accommodations right on Waikiki Beach.	
3204169	50000814	The hotel could do with a renovation, but I'm sure		80000900	Mahalo Nui Loa.	
3204169	50000815	When that happens the prices will rise.		80000901	Please come back again.	
3204169	50000816	So for now take advantage of the reasonable rates while you can!				
3204169	50000817	We stayed on the Royal Hawaiian side of the hotel which has amazing views, the only negative was the two very noisy vent fans on top of the Cheesecake Factory.				
3204169	50000818	Bit annoying if you want to relax on the lanai, but when the window is closed you can't hear it from the inside.				
3204169	50000819	The elevators are very slow but the hotel was at full capacity so it was understandable.				
3204169	50000820	Will stay again for sure.				
3204169	50000821	Mahalo Outrigger!				

3192279	50000830	Well worth the money!		80000912	Dear TheLadyChris, thank you for your recent review.	
3192279	50000831	---SEP---		80000913	With regards to the fire alarm sounding, this is for the safety of everyone in the building.	
3192279	50000832	I would've given 5 stars across the board, except for the early morning fire alarm going off!		80000914	We are pleased that you found our rooms clean and comfortable and our breakfast buffet tasty.	
3192279	50000833	It only lasted a couple of seconds, but it was enough to disturb my sleep.		80000915	We hope to see you again soon!	
3192279	50000834	The room itself was fab, lovely and clean.				
3192279	50000835	The bed was superbly comfortable.				
3192279	50000836	Breakfast buffet was really tasty, excellent choice and if our choice wasn't available the chef was willing to make it for us if possible.				
3192279	50000837	Would definitely recommend staying here!				

3235171	50000840	Right location and price for overnight stop over ---SEP--- Have stayed at Hotel previously and not had good encounter but on this trip was happy to see new management who assured us that other guests bad behaviour would not be tolerated.		80000926	Thank you for reviewing ibis Budget Dubbo, I am so happy that your second visit was better than the first.	
3235171	50000841	Felt welcome on check in and although the rooms are a bit small and bathroom/toilet likewise, I would recommend the hotel to anyone just wanting a budget overnight stay.		80000927	We hope to see you again very soon.	
3235171	50000842	We stayed on our way to Queensland and on our way back again as it is roughly half way.				
3235171	50000843	I recommend this hotel as a one night stop over to sleep and refresh but it's not what I would stay in for longer periods.				
3235171	50000844	Having said that, people stay in smaller rooms on cruise ships for 9 - 14 nights so as long as you only expect a bed to sleep in and your own toilet/shower, you won't be disappointed.				
3235171	50000845	If you want more than this I suggest you pay alot more for the added luxuries.				
3235171	50000846	At the price per night, won't get much better.				

3325961	50000850	Well located and worth the $ ---SEP--- Room sizes are excellent, hotel is extremely well located and the staff are first class.		80000938	Dear Tony C, Thank you for your ongoing patronage and loyalty to Sheraton on the Park!	
3325961	50000851	Every time I stay in Sydney which is frequently this hotel is one of my top picks.		80000939	Our associates do indeed endeavour to assist our guests whenever possible and I‚Äôm delighted they continue to provide such great customer service.	
3325961	50000852	If you are a Sheraton lover you will enjoy this hotel, put it on your list.		80000940	We look forward to welcoming you back to Sheraton on the Park on many more occasions!	
3325961	50000853	Of note when I checked inJune was extremely attentive to my needs and was very efficient on my arrival.		80000941	Warm regards, Bernhard Langer Hotel Manager	

3323551	50000860	Visiting London!		80000952	Dear Juliawong2078, I am delighted to read your fantastic feedback which you have kindly shared on Trip Advisor.	
3323551	50000861	---SEP---		80000953	The whole team especially Cosmina is ecstatic to learn that our Hotel provided the best experience for you.	
3323551	50000862	This hotel gave us a great experience during our stay in London.		80000954	We certainly hope that our Hotel remains at the top of your list every time you are in London.	
3323551	50000863	Cosmina, a staff at the reception, provided great services to us when we needed it.		80000955	It would be our pleasure to welcome you back.	
3323551	50000864	She also has a friendly and caring attitude, which elevated our experience.		80000956	Kind regards Luanne Dias Reception Manager	
3323551	50000865	Zdravko, a concerige at the hotel also provided us great services by guiding us with our way.				
3323551	50000866	The breakfast and rooms in this hotel are also up to standard, making it a pleasant stay.				

3318096	50000870	What a Great Find!		80000967	Thanks so much for your review, Zoe.	
3318096	50000871	---SEP---		80000968	It was great to have you back at the Sorrento again.	
3318096	50000872	This is the second time we have stayed at the Sorrento Apartments, because we enjoyed it so much the first time.		80000969	We do pride ourselves on both the way we present our apartments and in our customer service.	
3318096	50000873	We also had friends staying there for the third year in a row.		80000970	It is important to us that you enjoy your stay here and want to keep coming back.	
3318096	50000874	(It was their recommendation that convinced us.)		80000971	Hopefully we see you and Ulf back again soon.	
3318096	50000875	The apartment is conveniently located in the town centre.		80000972	Cheers Neale & Kathryn	
3318096	50000876	It was spotless, well-equipped and quiet.				
3318096	50000877	In particular we were impressed that Neale immediately responded to any queries/problems we had; namely, we could not work out how to use the DVD player and requested extra coat hangers.				
3318096	50000878	And when we left our holiday photos behind, he phoned straight away to tell me and posted them the next day true to his word.				
3318096	50000879	Five stars well deserved!				

3245459	50000880	Airport Hilton Hotel ---SEP---		80000983	Thank You for the great feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Phoenix Airport.	
3245459	50000881	This is the first time I have had an overall experience of 10 in a hotel in quite a while.		80000984	We are very proud of the wonderful service our employees provide our guests, thank you for recognizing them.	
3245459	50000882	Thank you for that!		80000985	It‚Äôs a delight to read that you had such a great experience at our property.	
3245459	50000883	It is a beautiful facility.		80000986	We look forward to welcoming you back!	
3245459	50000884	Service was uniformly excellent and staff were supportive and helpful.				
3245459	50000885	Everything was clean and neat.				
3245459	50000886	Waiting time was at a minimum for rides to airport and pick up.				

3257562	50000890	My stay.		80000997	The management and staff are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3257562	50000891	---SEP---		80000998	We appreciate your feedback, which enables us to deliver the best possible amenities and service.	
3257562	50000892	Very good hotel.		80000999	We hope to welcome you back to the Best Western Foreshore when you next visit to Hobart.	
3257562	50000893	I enjoyed my stay here while i was in Hobart.				
3257562	50000894	If ever I come to hobart for another stay will make sure i stay at the Foreshore Motel again.				
3257562	50000895	Room was excellent, bistro meals were awesome.				

3304942	50000900	Wifi ---SEP--- Hotel was good, clean and central but their was no Internet on my room.		80001000	Thank you for taking the time to post your review on TripAdvisor.	
3304942	50000901	I was lucky because I had data on my contract but not ideal for everyone		80001001	Im really happy to see how much you enjoyed your visit so much , and certainly on your next visit should you have any concerns regarding internet access , please do not hesitate to seek assistance from our reception team.	
3304942	50000902	Now I'm just writing anything to take my characters to over 200 as it won't let me submit less				

3161294	50000910	Worst sleep ever!		80001012	Dear Guest, Trip Advisor is a wonderful resource for all sorts of hospitality venues and their customers and guests alike.	
3161294	50000911	Noisy bus stop outside!!		80001013	Where it is not so useful is when guests decide to use it as a form of vengeance, particularly when it is the first time a venue has been made aware of a complaint.	
3161294	50000912	---SEP--- Stayed here with my young family last night and while the rooms and location are good, the ocean front rooms are opposite a bus stop which runs all night with noisy busses stopping every minute or so all night!		80001014	Whilst I agree that Manly is a bustling place and our particular location is very close to Manly Wharf and its transport connections, suggesting that buses leave every minute 24 hours a day is inaccurate and misleading.	
3161294	50000913	The entire room shakes and there is noise every time a bus stops out front.		80001015	Next time (not that it will be here by the looks of things) try and talk to the venue about your complaint while you are still there.	
3161294	50000914	Was so disappointing.		80001016	It would be better for both parties and you may just achieve a positive outcome.	
3161294	50000915	Had no sleep!!!		80001017	Kind Regards, Mark Stanley General Manager	
3161294	50000916	Would never stay again				

3282951	50000920	Lovely stay in bijou room ---SEP--- 2 nights enough for tiny room and no window.		80001028	Thank you Fran!	
3282951	50000921	I thought a window wouldn't matter, until you wake in the morning and no idea what time it could be by the light/dark NOT coming in through window.		80001029	Sounds like you had a great stay and I am delighted about that.	
3282951	50000922	Must take this into consideration as you do get the cheaper option to book a room without a window or not.		80001030	Like you say, if you have booked a room without a window it can be a bit confusing to know what time of day it is!	
3282951	50000923	So central, you will not be disappointed!		80001031	Brilliant if you want a lie in.	
3282951	50000924	‚ù§Ô∏è		80001032	:)	
3282951				80001033	I hope when you are next in Glasgow we will see you again.	
3282951				80001034	Regards, Ross	

3178096	50000930	Short stay ---SEP---		80001045	Dear Mark, Thank you for your kind review - Karl will appreciate your comments as he works very hard to help our customers enjoy themselves.	
3178096	50000931	Carl was very friendly and helpful.		80001046	You are also correct about the 'freshly decorated' rooms - most were decorated during the winter to keep our standards up for our customers.	
3178096	50000932	Nothing was too much trouble for him.		80001047	We hope to see you again soon.	
3178096	50000933	The room was very clean and looked freshly decorated.		80001048	Kind regards Sandy, David,Matt and Jon Oliver and Karl.	
3178096	50000934	Food was good too (although we only had breakfast).				
3178096	50000935	We would definately stay here again.				

3196790	50000940	Value ---SEP---		80001059	Aloha Oliveali: Mahalo for taking the time to write about your month long stay with us at the Aqua Palms.	
3196790	50000941	My husband and I stayed at the Aqua Palms for nearly a month when me moved to the island.		80001060	We hope you are getting settled into your new home and will still take the opportunity to stay with us again for a staycation!	
3196790	50000942	We were very happy with this hotel.		80001061	Me ke Aloha Pumehana, With Warmest Aloha, Patty Maher General Manager	
3196790	50000943	The staff is friendly and was very patient while answering question after question from me.				
3196790	50000944	There was a weekly manager's reception with pupus (appetizers) and music.				
3196790	50000945	I would suggest at least stopping by the lobby for this, if you're around when it's going on.				
3196790	50000946	There is an IHOP downstairs, and a diner style coffee house just next door.				
3196790	50000947	The hotel provides a shuttle to the mall, wal mart and other Aqua properties.				
3196790	50000948	They provide towel and beach chairs, which was very convenient.				
3196790	50000949	This property is not beach front, but the beach is only a short walk away.				
3196790	50000950	Our room was facing the Hilton property and we could see the ocean and Diamond Head from the lanai.				
3196790	50000951	Great view!				
3196790	50000952	Overall, couldn't have chosen a better place for the price!!				

3178178	50000960	Romantic, Charming, Comfortable ---SEP--- Thank you, Robert, Constanzia & Chris for our memorable 3 day stay in your wonderful log cabins.		80001072	Dear John C, Thank you so much for leaving us such a fantastic review.	
3178178	50000961	Others have more or less said it all - but to add a little: Our regular (middle of their price range) chalet (no 3, I think) had a superb view, & was brilliantly designed and equipped - we absolutely loved it & congratulate the family for their success in setting up this imaginative project.		80001073	It was an absolute pleasure having you stay with us and we wish you an enjoyable summer.	
3178178	50000962	Their hospitality was charming too - unobtrusive, but always had time to help one.		80001074	We hope to see you back here some day in the future.	
3178178	50000963	"The only possible improvement we could suggest to achieve perfection would be to ""extend"" the Wi Fi from reception to each of the chalets, but the bonus about having to pop down to reception to ""connect"" was invariably a pleasant chat with whichever member of the family was on duty."		80001075	All the best, Robert, Constanca and Chris	
3178178	50000964	Finally we thought it very good value for money @ 185 NZ$ per night.				
3178178	50000965	Would highly recommend others to make a detour on their NZ tour to visit this delightful area & accommodation.				

3199353	50000970	Great location, Neat clean and large rooms, perfect for families.		80001086	Thanks so much for the great review and sounds like the family enjoyed our home away from home.	
3199353	50000971	---SEP---		80001087	See you next time.

3199353	50000977	Loved the themed decorations around reception and the motel and the cute room designs.				

3283167	50000980	Overnight on the Way Home from Europe ---SEP---		80001099	Thank you for your awesome comments and for your 5-star review!	
3283167	50000981	My wife and I were returning from Europe and decided to spend the night in Denver before flying on to Portland.		80001100	We are so happy that you chose to spend the night with us after a long European journey.	
3283167	50000982	The Westin offered a convenient, easy transfer from plane to hotel to plane, only steps away from baggage claim right at the airport.		80001101	We hope that your trip home was fast and easy.	
3283167	50000983	The facility is recently opened and sparkling.		80001102	Please come back to visit us again!	
3283167	50000984	The lobby is a modern, clean and welcoming room.		80001103	Be well!	
3283167	50000985	The guest rooms on the south side of the building, where we stayed, offer a sensational view of incoming planes, an interesting lighted/log art display and the city beyond.				
3283167	50000986	The room was large and the bed was comfortable.				
3283167	50000987	For the tired traveler on a stop-over, or a business person seeking a conventient meeting venue, the Westin at Denver International would be ideal.				

3257155	50000990	Excellent Service, Excellent room.		80001114	Hello Isabella D, Thanks you so much for your amazing review.	
3257155	50000991	---SEP---		80001115	I am glad you loved your stay with us and the time you were with us Ballarat sure did turn on its cooler weather!	
3257155	50000992	We were in Ballarat to watch our grandsons play soccer.		80001116	I am glad you loved the gas log fire in your room.	
3257155	50000993	It was a really wet & cold weekend so the gas flame fire in the room was so cosy & welcome.		80001117	It was great	
3257155	50000994	We also had a room with a spa bath which was also very nice & relaxing after a cold day at the soccer.		80001118	having you guys stay with us.	
3257155	50000995	Our son, his wife & 3 boys were staying in the Hotel too and were also very pleased with their room.		80001119	These things happen with people mixing up their dates and we will always do our best to accommodate our guests and fortunately we were able to fix things up with the stroke of a pen!	
3257155	50000996	We all ate in the Hotel restaurant and the food was excellent.		80001120	I hope your son, daughter in law and the grandkids enjoyed their stay as much as you!	
3257155	50000997	The rooms were clean and ladies who were cleaning the rooms were very helpful and friendly.		80001121	I will pass on your lovely comments to our cleaning staff as they love getting praised and they sure do work hard.	
3257155	50000998	I had booked the room online and the day before we were to check in I realized I had stuffed up my dates.		80001122	We would love to have you guys back with us again and with a bit of luck the weather will play its part and you can explore everything Ballarat has to offer!	
3257155	50000999	After ringing & speaking to Lee he said not to worry that he would try to sort it out and would ring me back in 10 minutes.		80001123	We look forward to seeing you again, The Seymours Team	
3257155	50001000	Which he did and said he had managed to juggle a few rooms & we wouldn't have to move from one room to another for our 3 night stay.				
3257155	50001001	Great service.				
3257155	50001002	Lee & his wife were very nice & very helpful.				
3257155	50001003	If we ever get to Ballarat again we would have no hesitation on booking into Seymours On Lydiard.				
3257155	50001004	Thank you.				

3283939	50001010	Disappointed ---SEP--- Stayed 2 nights, food good first night ( I'm gluten and dairy free and was well catered for.		80001134	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your stay at the Great Northern Hotel.	
3283939	50001011	Second night different story, when it came to dessert order waitress didn't even give me a menu and proceeded to take orders from rest of party.		80001135	It is with great sadness to read that you encountered some issues when you stayed.	
3283939	50001012	I had to ask if they had fruit salad.		80001136	We take all comments good or bad on board and work with each department in question to resolve each problem.	
3283939	50001013	Bedrooms very warm and no bottles of water in them which very disappointing.		80001137	I would be delighted if you could email me directly to discuss the above issues.	
3283939	50001014	Not sure I would stay again.		80001138	briani@greatnorthernhotel.com	
3283939				80001139	Many thanks Brian McEniff	

3202069	50001020	Great Staycation ---SEP--- Beautiful property, great location.		80001140	Bonjour Fun8888, Thank you for choosing the Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour to accommodate you over the Australia Day weekend.	
3202069	50001021	Stay during the Australia Day period only for 2 days 1 night.		80001141	It was a pleasure having you	
3202069	50001022	Rooms was brilliantly done, modern & chic.		80001142	and I am delighted to read of your enjoyable experience.	
3202069	50001023	Wifi is great.		80001143	The Ambassadors and I look forward to welcoming you back again soon for an opportunity to experience Champagne Bar.	
3202069	50001024	Staff service is good and love the way your staff at the reception consistently asking the customers of their stay when checking out.		80001144	Kind Regards, Greg Brady	
3202069	50001025	Other areas i like was when rooms are not ready instead of waiting around the lobby you can actually go for lunch or run little side trips.				
3202069	50001026	Appreciate their return call to inform you once your rooms are ready.				
3202069	50001027	This certainly allow me time to wander around Darling Harbour.				
3202069	50001028	This is an area not a lot of hotels are committed to carry out.				
3202069	50001029	Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour well done.				
3202069	50001030	One feedback was the Champagne lounge closed early around 9pm on 27Janü§î20.				
3202069	50001031	This could be due to Australia Day.				
3202069	50001032	Small things beyond your control otherwise a solid stay.				
3202069	50001033	Will be back !!!

3278242	50001050	Perfect for an overnighter ---SEP---		80001171	Thanks for the great review.	
3278242	50001051	We have stayed here a couple of times now and it is always good.		80001172	See you again soon	
3278242	50001052	We ride in our motorbikes, and greeted with friendly smiles we have a hot shower and a good meal at the pub.				
3278242	50001053	A comfy sleep and its happy days..				
3278242	50001054	We will be back, probably over and over!				
3278242	50001055	:)				

3289693	50001060	Very average ---SEP---		80001183	Thanks for taking the time to provide us with your feedback, Shellie S. We were really disappointed to read your review as we pride ourselves on our normally high levels of friendly service and apologise that you did not feel you received this experience.	
3289693	50001061	On arrival the reception staff could barely put an effort in to welcoming you (very different to other Big 4 parks ).		80001184	We do our very best to have the rooms available at the 2pm check-in, however, maintenance issues can sometimes take extra time and we're sorry that this impacted on your stay.	
3289693	50001062	The cabin we booked wasn't ready until nearly an hour after check in time.		80001185	We do appreciate the opportunity to address some of your concerns and hope to see you on future travels!	
3289693	50001063	Reception hours limited compared to other parks.				
3289693	50001064	Facilities reasonable for kids but no where near other Big 4 parks.				
3289693	50001065	Won't be returning to this park again				

3189092	50001070	Extremely disappointing ---SEP---		80001196	J9P I am very sorry you had such a long wait for your rooms to be ready.	
3189092	50001071	We had booked adjoining rooms - but they were not ready and clean when we arrived at 4pm.		80001197	May I ask if my team offered alternate options for you when your arrived or at any point during your wait?	
3189092	50001072	We did not get access to one room until after 6:30.		80001198	Thank you very much for your patience with us.	
3189092	50001073	We were promised that when the second was ready, the keys would be personally delivered to our room.		80001199	I am very sorry that a message was left on your home phone, its the only number we have on file for you.	
3189092	50001074	We heard housekeeping leave the adjoining room, and yet no one came for over an hour.		80001200	I am very sorry that the pool chlorine levels caused an issue with your children, I trust they are okay?	
3189092	50001075	We finally went to the front desk, and at 7:45 we were told,		80001201	Our pool team must maintain certain levels of chlorine in all of the pools as per local health regulations, they do however try to keep them at the low end of the required levels and do monitor them regularly.	
3189092	50001076	oh yes, it is ready.		80001202	Again I am very sorry	
3189092	50001077	To top it off, when we got home for the weekend, there was a message on our HOME phone that the room was ready.		80001203	and I know you've stated that you'd prefer not to return	
3189092	50001078	What was the point of giving my cell number and email address??		80001204	but I know we can make your next experience a wonderful one.	
3189092	50001079	There was clearly not enough housekeeping staff.		80001205	Please let me know if you can forgive us and give us a 2nd chance.	
3189092	50001080	"The restaurant was ""out"" of a lot of menu items and the latte machine was broken (and we were told it probably wouldn't get fixed)."		80001206	I would love to personally handle your next reservation in Kingston please contact me directly at jrebelo@ambassadorhotel.com Jonathan Rebelo Guest Service Manager jrebelo@ambassadorhotel.com 613-548-3605-2119	
3189092	50001081	The pools were so highly chlorinated, both kids broke out in hot, burning rashes on their legs.				
3189092	50001082	Although the water park was fun, we would definitely not stay here again if an alternative was available.				

3265583	50001090	Marty's is wonderful ---SEP---		80001217	Hi Mandy

3265583	50001094	Staff are amazing and go above and beyond time and again.				

3307775	50001100	Very nice for A Fairfield Inn ---SEP--- Rooms were clean, restaurant was good and staff was very friendly.		80001231	Thank you for taking the time to post your feedback of the Fairfield Inn & Suites Charlotte Uptown and for sharing your great experience online.	
3307775	50001101	Free breakfast was not very good but consistent with other Fairfield Inn's and Springhill Suites.		80001232	We are delighted to read that you liked our clean accommodations, friendly associates along with the amenities and facilities that we have to offer.	
3307775	50001102	Gym was nicer then expected - decent amount of working equipment.		80001233	We do appreciate your observations and concerns and have also taken a note of it.	
3307775				80001234	We hope to have you back with us soon.	
3307775				80001235	Thank you again, Bill Moore General Manager Fairfield Inn & Suites Charlotte Uptown	

3233700	50001110	Hotel stay for grand national ---SEP---		80001246	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to leave your recent review.	
3233700	50001111	We recently stayed at The Shankly Hotel and was extremely pleased with the service provided, especially by Lucy.		80001247	I was happy to see you had a great stay and you decided you would like to stay again.	
3233700	50001112	She went out her way to look after and accommodate our group for the 3 nights spent in the bar.		80001248	I hope to welcome you back to us in the near future, and thank you for choosing The Shankly Hotel Liverpool.	
3233700	50001113	Would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel.		80001249	Warmest Wishes, Liam Bellew Guest Relations Manger	

3165768	50001120	Excellent venue - staff super super super amazing!		80001250	Both this review and the email you were so kind as to send me personally are really appreciated.	
3165768	50001121	---SEP---		80001251	To be chosen by a couple to be the venue for both their marriage and reception is a very great compliment and to read that we also succeeded in delighting their guests really is cream on the cake.	
3165768	50001122	Recently attended a wedding held at the Fairlawns and it was the first time both my husband and I had ever been there - it was brilliant!		80001252	The team join me in thanking you for sharing your experiences with potential customers.	
3165768	50001123	The venue is stunning, food excellent and the staff...		80001253	We are a family business so this really makes a difference.	
3165768	50001124	well I don‚Äôt like to use the word perfect very often (mainly because perfect seems so final, and let‚Äôs face it, is there anything in this world really that could not be made even a little bit better!?)		80001254	Thank you so much and please come back soon.	
3165768	50001125	but these guys and gals are as close to perfect as you can find!				
3165768	50001126	I have been to many wedding's held in hotel's and with work I stay in a lot of hotels all over the country				
3165768	50001127	yet this is the first time I have thought so highly of the venue/staff that I wanted to write a positive review.				
3165768	50001128	Ideal wedding venue as it has all the romance and charm required to set a great atmosphere.				
3165768	50001129	The layout also means that you still feel like you are having your own private celebrations even though there are other people using the hotel too.				
3165768	50001130	The same room was used to go from day to night and they did this in such quick time it did not interfere with the flow of the day one bit!				
3165768	50001131	The food was fantastic, proper food in decent portion sizes... was pretty stuffed by the end of our 4 course wedding breakfast!				
3165768	50001132	I didn‚Äôt have any evening buffet but there were many compliments from other guests that did.				
3165768	50001133	Our room was just what we needed for the overnight stay (bed a little hard but that maybe because I have a memory foam mattress at home - so hardly really the fault of the hotel!)				
3165768	50001134	The following day after the wedding there was a few of us girls that spent a good few hours around the spa.				
3165768	50001135	It never seemed overcrowded and the facilities are excellent!				
3165768	50001136	Will definitely look to book to go back and hopefully enjoy a bit more time in the spa as well as book some treatments.				
3165768	50001137	Finally the whole reason why I wanted to write this review - the staff.				
3165768	50001138	I have been to many a hotel where the staff are very professional but just don‚Äôt seem that happy to be there...				
3165768	50001139	I would find it unbelievable for anyone to say that about the Fairlawns.				
3165768	50001140	Ultra professional, polite, discreet, accommodating and happy!				
3165768	50001141	Friendly smiles all day, nothing was too much trouble and when chatting to them it all felt very genuine which was the icing on the cake!				
3165768	50001142	Wonderful experience, I would stay here again and recommend to others.				
3165768	50001143	I am sure that there are improvements and sometimes things don‚Äôt go to plan and are not perfect however I really believe that if you find too many faults with this place then you are probably trying your hardest to find some!				

3205407	50001150	5 STARS!		80001265	Aloha!	
3205407	50001151	---SEP---		80001266	Thank you for staying with us and sharing your review.	
3205407	50001152	We really enjoyed our stay at the shoreline hotel.		80001267	Your encouraging comments are greatly appreciated, and our team will continue to provide the top notch service we have become known for.	
3205407	50001153	All the staff were very friendly, we always got greeted with a good morning or welcome back which is small yet sweet.		80001268	Please share your experience with your friends and family and we‚Äôll be sure to spread the Aloha.	
3205407	50001154	One of the ladies of the front desk gave us some good recommendations for dinner and showed us how to get there by a map.		80001269	Mahalo, Jerome Yapching Assistant Front Office Manager	
3205407	50001155	It is conveniently located, just a short walk to the beach, trolleys and cafes etc.				
3205407	50001156	The rooms are quite modern and comfortable.				
3205407	50001157	Free wifi and free beach towels are also available to use from the front desk which is handy!				
3205407	50001158	Overall we really enjoyed our stay!				

3184891	50001160	Not bad, not great.		80001270	Thanks for taking the time to review our hotel We are glad to hear you found location very convenient and our staff helpful and friendly.	
3184891	50001161	---SEP--- Had to stay here due to a housing emergency.		80001271	We look forward to seeing you again under more pleasant curcumstances.	
3184891	50001162	Staff were friendly and accommodating but the hotel is just plain loud.				
3184891	50001163	Could hear every footstep down the hall and the room above me.				
3184891	50001164	Location is super convenient though, especially if you are visiting and on foot.				
3184891	50001165	And the hotel is kept pretty clean.				

3291573	50001170	Under 13 Hockey State Championships ---SEP---		80001282	Thank you for your lovely review.	
3291573	50001171	This was our first time stay in this motel in Grafton.		80001283	Looking forward to seeing you all next time you're in town.	
3291573	50001172	We had over 60 staying and the hosts, John & Cesia, were very hospitable to our under 13 boys and their parents.		80001284	Kind regards, Charlotte	
3291573	50001173	Nice clean rooms with comfortable beds.				
3291573	50001174	Great location, walking distance to the main shops, restaurants, pubs & hockey fields.				
3291573	50001175	We are sure to return to Grafton again and would love to stay again!				

3189194	50001180	Common sense isn't common ---SEP---		80001295	Dear Nale Thank you for returning to stay at The Crowne Plaza Belfast.	
3189194	50001181	I first visted crown plaza hotel Belfast in July 2019 for my birthday and service was really good so decided to visit them again this month when I was in the beautiful city.		80001296	Your kind words and sentiments are greatly appreciated, and am delighted that our team was able to provide a friendly and acommodating service during this visit to our hotel.	
3189194	50001182	I'am aware every organisation has rules and I do respect that but common sense isn't always applied and people tend to be rigid on straight forward things.		80001297	We are always at hand to assist to make all our guests stay a enjoyable and comfortable experience after their long journey.	
3189194	50001183	I'm happy to say I was so impressed with the level of service given to me by the manager who was on duty on the 18th October 2019.		80001298	Regards Geraldine McLarnon	
3189194	50001184	My husband booked the room, my 2 daughters and I got there before him, the young lady at reception told me unfortunately I would have to pay first before I was checked in , unfortunately I did not have the money and my husband would only be off work later that day, I tried calling him but understandably he did not have his phone on him.				
3189194	50001185	I then asked for the manager and explained the kids and I have been on the road from Scotland since early hours of the morning and where very tired and would like to settle in our rooms, i promised to pay the bill the minute he would get there , I know it wasn't her problem that we didn't realise giving card details when we booked did not mean we had paid but instead she said she would let us into the room and to please pay before end of the day, she noticed I was getting stressed and tried to calm me down, I did appreciate that sort of service because nowadays people fail to see the bigger picture and just stick to what they've been trained to do and no common sense is applied whatsoever.				
3189194	50001186	Would definitely recommend and will be visiting next time I'm in town.				

3270988	50001190	Good clean accomodation great location ---SEP--- Stayed 6 nights at Melaleuca Resort and would have no problem staying there again .		80001309	Hi DavidB0962_12.	
3270988	50001191	The apartments are a good size and have all the things you need .		80001310	Thankyou for your glowing review.	
3270988	50001192	In fact out of the six night we ate in on 4 of them .		80001311	It is our pleasure to assist in any way we can to help you with your visit to Palm Cove.	
3270988	50001193	We use the BBQ which was brand new and the pool area and gardens are lovely and well maintained .		80001312	Although there is a great selection of restaurants nearby some guests prefer to use the BBQ and out door dinning area by the pool or their own fully equipped apartment kitchen.	
3270988	50001194	The Managers Steve and Margaret are fabulous .		80001313	To help with the longer stays, we are happy to run you up to the Supermarket for those essentials (also the Bottle Shop and Butcher).	
3270988	50001195	On the day we arrived Steve asked if we would like to be taken to the nearby Coles supermarket to get our groceries .		80001314	We hope we will see you again soon and you can do it all again.	
3270988	50001196	He took us himself ...now that is service		80001315	Happy travels Steve and Marg.	

3277612	50001200	They just didn't seem to care.		80001326	Dear cindytaylor1229, I am beyond disappointed that you did not have a great experience with us.	
3277612	50001201	---SEP---		80001327	I can assure you the last thing we would want is for you to feel any form of compensation is an insult.	
3277612	50001202	Had several issues throughout 5 day stay.		80001328	Although we are obviously regretful about the service you experienced with the concierge desk and Barlines, we appreciate you sharing this with us so we can communicate with our teams to improve.	
3277612	50001203	"Received ""free drink voucher"" each time, however, drinks did not solve the issues and it was insulting to be treated as if it would."		80001329	Please know this is not typical of the experience we typically deliver.	
3277612	50001204	Concierge was not helpful at all and ended up costing me money because the info he did provide was completely inaccurate.		80001330	We hope you will consider giving us another chance in the future Sincerely, K. Friedrichs Executive Office	
3277612	50001205	Hotel restaurant Barlines had a 1 or 2 bartenders that were beyond rude despite other staff that were very nice.				

3221718	50001210	Vacation at the beach ---SEP---		80001341	Thank you jkpatalanta, We could not be happier that your vacation at the beach was a great time.	
3221718	50001211	This hotel was a great, great deal for the room Very friendly staff and great location.		80001342	Thank you for your kind words.	
3221718	50001212	the pool was great and heated.		80001343	The accessibility of the bikes really gives you a great vantage point to see Fort Lauderdale, glad you enjoyed all the amenities.	
3221718	50001213	Breakfast very convinent.		80001344	We hope to see you again soon.	
3221718	50001214	The ability to rent a bike from the hotel was a nice bonus.				

3243933	50001220	THANK YOU FAIRMONT JASPER PARK LODGE ---SEP---		80001355	Dear Mr. Carrigan, Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your recent stay with us here at Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge.	
3243933	50001221	Exceptional hotels should have exemplary practices that ensure the best possible experience for guests to their properties.		80001356	I am thrilled to read that your experience during your recent stay was made so unique and memorable by our Golf staff, and more specifically our Head Golf Professional Tahlon Sweenie.	
3243933	50001222	After reviewing my TripAdvisor article in December 2014, Fairmont JPL immediately contacted me to discuss the issues that created a less than satisfactory visit.		80001357	It is through reviews such as yours that we're able to improve and I would like to thank you for your recent review as well showing that we've been able to create a positive lasting memory.	
3243933	50001223	Without argument JPL offered me the opportunity to return to their property at no cost and even offered me free golf and rental clubs for 2.		80001358	I will be sure to forward your thanks and compliments to our team.	
3243933	50001224	On June 13 and 14, 2016 I returned to JPL and thoroughly enjoyed two nights in a Junior Suite on the lake.		80001359	I look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	
3243933	50001225	Golf at JPL is the ultimate golfing experience.		80001360	Thank you, Ken Hall General Manager Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge

3243933	50001229	Wayne Carrigan				

3310784	50001230	Unique And Outstanding!!!		80001371	Bonjour R G, Thank you for your continued loyalty to the Chateau Frontenac, we are honored to be your favorite hotel in Quebec City.	
3310784	50001231	---SEP---		80001372	I was so pleased to read your wonderful feedback regarding the newly Chateau.	
3310784	50001232	We have been coming here for over 25 years and are continually drawn back by the beauty and charm of this grand hotel.		80001373	You have perfectly described the experience we wish to offer guests with the Chateau!	
3310784	50001233	The rooms are immaculate and extremely well maintained.		80001374	Thank you for taking time to share feedback and we look forward to your next visit.	
3310784	50001234	All the staff, from front desk to housekeeping to bellmen, provide superior customer service at all times - they are amazing!		80001375	Sincerely, Patricia Carre Rooms Division Director	
3310784	50001235	We have come to know some of the staff personally and are very appreciative of their attention to our needs.				
3310784	50001236	The restaurants are first class and the bars are always fun.				
3310784	50001237	This hotel is truly a special place to stay.				
3310784	50001238	There are some fine hotels in Quebec City but there are none that compare to Le Chateau Frontenac.				

3272111	50001240	Could try harder ---SEP--- Came here for cocktails to celebrate special occasion last week.		80001386	Thank you for your recent feedback.	
3272111	50001241	We were expecting to pay top prices and so were not surprised at the bill.		80001387	We all take great pride in providing our guests with the highest standards of service and for this reason I am sorry that we failed to meet your expectations on this occasion.	
3272111	50001242	We had also particularly wanted to hear the excellent swing singer Matt van Kan - he was superb but it must be unrewarding to perform in such a cramped and noisy location.		80001388	Your comments have been noted and passed to the relevant departments.	
3272111	50001243	Drinks were good - not astounding but good - but bar service diabolical.		80001389	With kind regards.	
3272111	50001244	In the end my husband ordered at bar which was equally understaffed.		80001390	Andrew Mosley	
3272111	50001245	The main bar is stuffy, badly lit and the furniture is just awkwardly arranged.				
3272111	50001246	You are climbing over people to get through the room.				
3272111	50001247	In major need of modernisation.				
3272111	50001248	No nibbles offered.				
3272111	50001249	Bonus - we saw the US rugby team arrive!				

3238831	50001250	Radisson stay during Christmas Party ---SEP--- Absolutely amazing stay as always.		80001401	Thank you so much for the 5 Star review, I have the pleasure of working with exception people and they are truly the greatest strength we have.	
3238831	50001251	Nab a corner room and enjoy gorgeous river and bridge views.		80001402	The Banana Bread French Toast is my favorite, so glad you enjoyed it.	
3238831	50001252	Downtown right out the front door with unique shops and Midtown Mall.		80001403	Season‚Äôs greetings and Travel safe!	
3238831	50001253	Take advantage of the $15 parking fee and even your car can enjoy the hotel's heated underground parking.		80001404	Patty	
3238831	50001254	Very friendly staff always ready to make your stay perfect.				
3238831	50001255	In the morning, do not leave until you experience the Banana Bread French Toast!				

3246151	50001260	What a great deal!!		80001415	I was delighted you enjoyed your visit on our special one off deal.	
3246151	50001261	---SEP---		80001416	We hope to welcome you back again soon.	
3246151	50001262	My partner and I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights.				
3246151	50001263	We had booked with an offer and paid ¬£65 for the both of us to stay for two nights with an all you can eat breakfast both mornings, as well as a bottle of bubbly and chocolates on arrival - worth ¬£370.				
3246151	50001264	I can't talk highly enough of this hotel.				
3246151	50001265	The staff were so pleasant and friendly and were there for our every need.				
3246151	50001266	The food was good although I would have appreciated more choice.				
3246151	50001267	The room was a mini-suite and was beautiful!				
3246151	50001268	I thought the bed was lovely and comfy but my partner (who suffers from a bad back) thought otherwise as it made his neck and back ache.				
3246151	50001269	As well as this, we were able to hear the banging of doors and voices coming from downstairs, so this did affect with our sleeping.				
3246151	50001270	The hotel isn't really that close to much, but the train station is very close with trains going to leeds, york and harrogate and we were given a free shuttle service to and from it.				
3246151	50001271	I was very excited to see on the website that there was a spa was NOW available, but then when I asked about at the reception, I was told that it was still being built..				
3246151	50001272	So the website was misleading on that part.				
3246151	50001273	But apart from that we had a lovely time!..				

3317064	50001280	Wedding reception ---SEP---		80001427	Good Afternoon DubaiDoug, Thank you for your wonderful review of your recent wedding experience with us.	
3317064	50001281	Just attended a wedding reception yesterday here at this hotel and feel the need to review it as it was just a great experience all round.		80001428	It is great to hear that the hard work of our wedding coordinator Nora and her team can be seen with the quality of food and service for all guests not just the bride & groom.	
3317064	50001282	From the minute we arrived and were served tea, coffee, tiny scones and homemade biscuits with attending musicians in the foyer bar it was just top notch service.		80001429	I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and hope to welcome you through our doors in the future.	
3317064	50001283	Also then provided hors d'oeuvres which were very good.		80001430	Kindest Regards, Paul Gill, General Manager	
3317064	50001284	The actual wedding dinner showed how despite having to cater for about 230 guests, you can still serve piping hot, quality food to this large number.				
3317064	50001285	You only do that with a great team who work together and are well trained and managed.				
3317064	50001286	The menu was a large puff pastry case with chicken which was very nice, a soup that was perfect, followed by a choice of cod or beef medallions.				
3317064	50001287	That is the only point of criticism I would have in that, in Ireland a large number of folk like their meat well done and this was well done!				
3317064	50001288	The meat was great quality so flavor was still there				
3317064	50001289	but you can't taste that quality fully if its more than medium rare or medium!				
3317064	50001290	The plate had two large medallions and lot of extras and staff were round with seconds if you wished.				
3317064	50001291	There was a desert, then tea and coffee.				
3317064	50001292	Then had a traditional ceilidh band and yet more food with super sandwiches and cocktail sausages etc.				
3317064	50001293	God help us if we went hungry for more than two hours!				
3317064	50001294	Recommend this hotel for special occasions whether wedding, confirmations or just a special celebration.				
3317064	50001295	Well done to the management and staff for making the bride and groom plus all the attending guests day so memorable.				

3196489	50001300	No access to the rooftop ---SEP--- Hotel is OK, room is OK, very clean, ratio price quality is well respected, location is great but - come on - how can you privatize the rooftop bar on a saturday without warning your customers ?		80001441	Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback.	
3196489	50001301	That was one of the great factors why we chose this hotel, the great view from the rooftop.		80001442	While it's always a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed many features of the hotel, I'm sorry that your overall experience was impacted by your bar experience.	
3196489	50001302	We came back earlier from our visits on Saturday specially to enjoy a coktail on the terrace but it was privatized for a teenagers party !		80001443	We strive to deliver an attentive and gracious service for every one of our guests, and I'm disappointed that we fell below your expectations on this occasion.	
3196489	50001303	I mentioned this trouble at the reception and they all totaly understood the fact that I was unhappy but they said they could not do anything with the strategy of the hotel.		80001444	I hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back to Mondrian London in the future.	
3196489	50001304	I think that the hotel should have at least offered a drink to the customers at the ground floor bar (even if it's not the same at all...)		80001445	Warm regards, Sergio	
3196489	50001305	but in our case there was no effort at all so this experience takes off 1 star.				
3196489	50001306	Sorry for that				
3196489	50001307	but there was a serious lack of communication with your customers !				
3196489	50001308	Next time, please warn your customers before they book so that there is no bad surprise...				

3244725	50001310	The standard of customer service is what sets this hotel apart ---SEP---		80001456	Thank you for your fantastic review on Trip Advisor.	
3244725	50001311	My husband and I booked a weekend break ( two nights B and B with one evening meal ) recently and we were delighted with a complimentary upgrade to a lake view room - thanks William!		80001457	It was great to hear that you and your husband enjoyed your weekend break and that the weather did not dampen your experience here at The Hodson Bay Hotel.	
3244725	50001312	On the Friday evening we ate in the carvery which was fine but the highlight was our Saturday night meal in the restaurant.		80001458	I was delighted to read that you found the customer service throughout the hotel to be of the standard we expect here on a consistent basis.	
3244725	50001313	The food was really lovely but it was the standard of customer service which really stood out.		80001459	I have passed on your kind words and displayed your comments in our team‚Äôs facilities as I think it‚Äôs important that staff get recognition for their hard work and dedication especially in these tough, economic and challenging times.	
3244725	50001314	The place was buzzing, with large family groups as well as tables of two, four and six but the staff operated with the efficiency of a well oiled machine and with genuine warmth and friendliness.		80001460	I was delighted that you got the opportunity to experience our full range of facilities here at the hotel and we are very privileged to have a natural waterside location outside our door.	
3244725	50001315	In fact that was our experience throughout the whole weekend.		80001461	I have spoken to ‚ÄòViking Mike‚Äô as he is known locally and he would also like to thank you for your very kind words.	
3244725	50001316	Every time we met a staff member in the bar, reception or simply walking in the corridor they made eye contact, smiled and greeted us.		80001462	We would love to welcome you back to the hotel.	
3244725	50001317	It's small things like this that make a big difference - other hotels take note.		80001463	If you ever decide to return, please do not hesitate to contact me	
3244725	50001318	Our package included a return Viking cruise to Athlone with Michael, a fantastic guide, whose knowledge of, and passion for the lake and it's history and geography made for a great journey.		80001464	so I get the opportunity to meet you both in person and thank you for very kind words.	
3244725	50001319	Did I mention it rained for the entire weekend?		80001465	Yours sincerely, Timothy Hayes	
3244725	50001320	Ordinarily that would have cast a shadow over the break but our experience in the Hodson Bay more than made up for the weather.				
3244725	50001321	No, I'm not employed by the hotel or in any way connected to anyone who works there just somebody who appreciates good food and great customer service.				
3244725	50001322	We are already looking forward to a return visit.				

3291719	50001330	When next in Brisbane stay at the Next Hotel ---SEP---		80001476	Dear Ivana262018, I am glad to see you were able to take full advantage of our central location.	
3291719	50001331	I have been a couple of times - every stay was pleasant and comfortable.		80001477	I hope you enjoyed the show at QPAC.	
3291719	50001332	Hotel is situated in Queen Street Mall with access to shops and the train station is not too far and QPAC is just across the bridge.		80001478	Thank you for stay and we look forward to welcoming you back again shortly.	
3291719				80001479	Kind regards, Mathieu	

3304517	50001340	Good moden hotel in an ideal location ---SEP--- Stayed only 1 night at the Breakfree on Cashel on our recent visit in Christchurch.		80001480	Kia ora bevandroy, Thank you very much for sharing with our readers the great feedback relating to your recent stay with us at BreakFree on Cashel.	
3304517	50001341	Good location short walk to cardboard cathedral can see from hotel.		80001481	We are delighted to read that we have exceeded your expectations and do look forward to welcoming you back to stay with us at BreakFree on Cashel sometime very soon.	
3304517	50001342	Near to restaurant, bars in Regent Street and also within easy walking distance to other central sights.		80001482	Kind regards Graeme and the BreakFree on Cashel team.	
3304517	50001343	Rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable beds.				
3304517	50001344	Would recommend and stay again.				
3304517	50001345	All staff very helpful and pleasant.				
3304517	50001346	Didn't have chance to eat in hotel but busy in bar area so must be good.				

3307192	50001350	the balcony was really especial ---SEP---		80001493	Hi Ralsen C, Thank you for taking the time to leave such a fantastic review.	
3307192	50001351	I stayed for 2 nights, and everything was perfect.		80001494	We look forward to having you stay with us again.	
3307192	50001352	I asked the reception, while doing the check in, to put me in a room with fast access to the lift, so I could get outside the building easily to smoke.		80001495	Kind Regards, Mark Winter Operations Manager	
3307192	50001353	They put me in the 4th level, in the room with a balcony, so I didn't need to get outside to smoke.				
3307192	50001354	The room is just huge, for a double room.				
3307192	50001355	The complementary mini bar was the best selection of drinks and snacks that I had (I did stayed in others Indigo Hotels, and they do keep up,but in newcastle the selection was perfect for me).				
3307192	50001356	I had some trouble to get in the hotel with my car, cause the neighbor area was going through rebuilding, but the location cross to the station is perfect for a tourist.				

3224870	50001360	Style and Tranquility ---SEP---		80001506	Thanks for the fantastic post on Trip Advisor.	
3224870	50001361	We have stayed at the Park Hyatt in Melbourne many times.		80001507	Really appreciated your candid comments!	
3224870	50001362	It is always our hotel of choice when in Melbourne.		80001508	You touched on all of what we like to think sets us apart from our competitor set!	
3224870	50001363	It is situated at the edge of the city, but close enough to walk to everywhere within the CBD, East Melbourne or Carlton.		80001509	So and that said, I think fair to say that we exceeded your expectations!!	
3224870	50001364	Also close to the wonderfully unique (and extensive) tram lines and train station.		80001510	Also great to see that you have been here before and that this was not your first stay‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.	
3224870	50001365	The hotel itself is an oasis of calm in the city.		80001511	I hope you‚Äôll both return again soon and that when you do you will contact me directly so that I can personally assist you.	
3224870	50001366	From the minute you arrive, the Concierge and Bell Staff are attentive, the reception is welcome and the room heavenly comfortable.		80001512	I write this trusting that you are well.	
3224870	50001367	Truly the best hotel in Melbourne.		80001513	Very best regards, Sholto Sholto Smith (Mr) Hotel Manager Park Hyatt Melbourne 1 Parliament Square, Off Parliament Place Melbourne, Victoria 3002

3260463	50001370	Great but too pricey ---SEP---		80001526	Thank you for your review of your stay.	
3260463	50001371	We had a wonderful time at this lovely hotel.		80001527	We are delighted that aspects of your stay, such as the hospitality overall and some of the local activities, were very enjoyable for you.	
3260463	50001372	Staff great amenities great location great.		80001528	With over 700 guestrooms to choose from in a numerous locations, there are a variety of options that are designed to suit the needs of different types of guests and stays.	
3260463	50001373	We stayed on the gold level.		80001529	Please do consider a return, even if Fairmont Gold is not your product of choice in Banff.	
3260463	50001374	Tis allowed us use of the lounge.		80001530	The Fairmont Banff Springs	
3260463	50001375	The snacks were nice,modest.				
3260463	50001376	The breakfast was pleasant light.				
3260463	50001377	However at night you had to pay for your wine beer etc.				
3260463	50001378	now we paid $800 per night for our rooms we had 3 so this was not cheap.				
3260463	50001379	However having to pay for a wine to the tune of $11 per glass is a bit rich.				
3260463	50001380	The rooms were nice but let me tell you about the tiny bathrooms.				
3260463	50001381	"I am 6'2"" and 210 lbs with size 12feet couldn't close the door very easily."				
3260463	50001382	You had to close the door in order to get in front of the sink.				
3260463	50001383	No counter space 1 sink and a shower.				
3260463	50001384	Extremely efficient design read small.				
3260463	50001385	The staff was pleasant and helpful.				
3260463	50001386	They were mainly Australians and New Zealanders.				
3260463	50001387	Took the bus to ski sunshine, a 4 mile backup to the hill got there there was 1000s of people stayed on the bus and skipped it.				
3260463	50001388	Do not go over the Xmas holidays if you can swing it.				
3260463	50001389	Way too many people.				
3260463	50001390	Went curling locally a blast, then Canadian bowling also a must do.				
3260463	50001391	The town has many shops and restaurants bars pubs everything.				
3260463	50001392	Lots of fun wonderful people these Canadians WONDERFUL polite great Being there are not too many other places to chose from don't have good suggestions.				
3260463	50001393	Do not pay extra for the gold level for it is not worth it by a long shot.

3251911	50001410	Hampton Inn & Suites- Denver, Downtown ---SEP---		80001558	isabella147, I would like to apologize for the initial interaction you had with one of our staff members, but I am very pleased to hear that the rest of your stay with us went well and you were able to relax before hitting Red Rocks for a concert!	
3251911	50001411	The location was extremely convenient- we walked almost everywhere.		80001559	We look forward to seeing you the next time your travels bring you to Denver and thank you for taking the time to share your review with us on Trip Advisor!	
3251911	50001412	The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.		80001560	Chanel Stuckenschneider Front Office Manager	
3251911	50001413	Thankfully, after our 15 hour drive and 2 night camping adventure in the mountains we were able to check in early to get ready and relax before our Red Rocks show!!				
3251911	50001414	Only had one unpleasant encounter with a staff member while trying to check in but other than her, everyone was great.				
3251911	50001415	Highly recommend staying here, I will definitely be staying here again when I go back.				

3260449	50001420	Very relaxing ---SEP---		80001571	Hi 542Jarrety	
3260449	50001421	Was a very great stay will defently be back for all further business meeting.		80001572	Thank you for taking the time to review our property.	
3260449	50001422	Awesome staff and managment..Check inns and check outs were so easy which made the stay so much more comfortable and relaxing		80001573	It was great to read that you thoroughly enjoyed your stay with us and you found the staff helpful and friendly.	
3260449				80001574	I look forward to welcoming you back in the future.	
3260449				80001575	Kind Regards, Tim H	

3188073	50001430	top class ---SEP---		80001586	Thank you for taking the time to write a review about Endeavour Lodge.	
3188073	50001431	A wonderful introduction to Norfolk Island/great views over the smaller islands/ friendly, helpful staff/ very cooperative people organizing outings and tours; loved the fish fry and the service we had with regards our vehicle.		80001587	It is pleasing to hear you enjoyed your holiday with us.	

3223548	50001440	Family trip with 8 month old ---SEP---		80001598	Thank you for taking the time to share your experience after your recent trip to the Rimrock.	
3223548	50001441	The Hotel: Pros -Friendly staff -Clean -Underground heated parking (you do have to pay		80001599	We appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback on areas which we can implement change, and also what we are already doing well.	
3223548	50001442	but I had a package deal that included parking)		80001600	We look forward to your next stay with us!	
3223548	50001443	-Bus		80001601	Yours In Hospitality, Rimrock Resort Hotel Management	
3223548	50001444	stop right out front of the hotel to go downtown.				
3223548	50001445	This was super easy even with an 8mth old in a stroller.				
3223548	50001446	Very convenient and no stress about finding parking downtown.				
3223548	50001447	-Easy check out from t.v. in room				
3223548	50001448	and we were able to see our bill at anytime using the t.v.				
3223548	50001449	Cons -Elevators can be slow and are old.				
3223548	50001450	The south wing elevator smelled like propane a lot of the time when catching it from the 4th floor.				
3223548	50001451	-Super expensive movie rentals.				
3223548	50001452	One movie was 16.99!!				
3223548	50001453	That is more than going to the movie theatre to see a 3D movie.				
3223548	50001454	They did have some for 4.99 but nothing we wanted to see.				
3223548	50001455	-Carpet is a bit dated The Room: Pros -Good view (room 479)				
3223548	50001456	-Clean -Close to spa/pool -Had two sinks -They brought a playpen for our daughter to sleep in and it was clean and in good condition -In room safe to put valuables Cons -Was cold until we figured out how to turn off the fan that was blowing cold air onto the bed.				
3223548	50001457	Once the fan was off it was a little hot				
3223548	50001458	but we just turned the fan back on to cool it off a bit.				
3223548	50001459	-One of our sinks wouldn't drain -Bathroom is small and the shower head was lower than expected but these weren't that much of an issue Pool:				
3223548	50001460	Pros -Easy access -Good hours of service -Pool was a little cold when we went around 8pm but seemed warmer the next morning when we went around 10				
3223548	50001461	am -Not crowded (Not sure how it would be during high season or weekends.				
3223548	50001462	We went mid week and there were only 2 other people swimming)				
3223548	50001463	Cons -As stated above pool felt a little cold when swimming after 8pm -A little small if it had been busy Restaurants:				
3223548	50001464	Primrose -It was closed when we were there but the food was being served at the Larkspur.				
3223548	50001465	We ordered the Chicken Pesto pasta and it was absolutely terrible.				
3223548	50001466	It was ridiculously over priced and we were very disappointed!				
3223548	50001467	-We also ordered a chocolate milkshake				
3223548	50001468	and it was basically just cold milk.				
3223548	50001469	It didn't taste like chocolate and was a very thin consistency and not worth the $8.00 charge.				
3223548	50001470	Larkspur -Excellent food (we had the Rimrock burger and it was absolutely delicious).				
3223548	50001471	The fries were excellent as well -Good service and beautiful view -Food was well priced, about the same cost as eating at an Earls Traveling with an 8month old to this hotel: Pros -Restaurant and staff were helpful with the baby (playpen for baby to sleep in provided and they had high chairs/booster seats at the restaurant) -Parking was heated and underground which helped with the cold weather -Baby was able to use the pool -In hotel convenience store if you need to purchase items -Fridge in room to put baby food and formula in -Walking distance to the Gondola and the Hot Springs.				
3223548	50001472	We didn't have to spend time strapping the baby into her carseat to get to the hot springs.				
3223548	50001473	We just put her in her stroller and we were there in less than 10 minutes.				
3223548	50001474	Cons -Finding a bathroom to change baby in.				
3223548	50001475	The Primrose had a very nice bathroom with a change table.				
3223548	50001476	However, the night that it was closed I had difficulty finding a washroom with a change table.				
3223548	50001477	I ended up having to change my baby on the floor of the washroom.				
3223548	50001478	We would definitely stay at this hotel with our baby again!				
3223548	50001479	I was worried about how far from downtown Banff it was with a baby.				
3223548	50001480	However, with the free bus pass provided and the bus stop right outside the hotel door it was super easy.				
3223548	50001481	I would recommend bringing an umbrella stroller rather than a full size stroller.				

3303661	50001490	Customer service at it's best ---SEP---		80001612	Thank you for your wonderful feedback.	
3303661	50001491	We stayed for 3 nights when the weather was decidedly miserable, but the hotel accommodation, staff and food more than made up for the rain.		80001613	The Oxford Garden Room is fantastic and is one of our most requested rooms.	
3303661	50001492	We stayed in the Oxford Garden Room, which was quiet and extremely comfortable and also had a very modern and up to date bathroom.		80001614	I‚Äôm so pleased you enjoyed your food in our bar whilst enjoying the company of your dog.	
3303661	50001493	The water pressure in the shower was great.		80001615	As you know we do not permit dogs in our restaurant, but we are happy to lay tables in either our bar or one of our comfortable lounges.	
3303661	50001494	We ate our breakfast and evening meals in the bar as we had our dog with us.		80001616	We look forward to you all returning in the future.	
3303661	50001495	Every dish was superb.		80001617	Regards Duncan Craig	
3303661	50001496	The staff at the hotel were first class, nothing was too much trouble.				
3303661	50001497	"Any request we made was received with a ""can do"" attitude."				
3303661	50001498	They were positive, helpful and friendly.				
3303661	50001499	A great asset to a great hotel.				
3303661	50001500	We will be returning.				
3303661	50001501	Highly recommended.				

3224613	50001510	Almost got it right...		80001628	Thank you for taking the time out and writing a review about the Quality Inn!	
3224613	50001511	---SEP---		80001629	We appreciate your comments and will use them to make improvements.	
3224613	50001512	The location, value, comfort and such were all quite acceptable.		80001630	We hope to see you again!	
3224613	50001513	I was not asked if an accessible room would be acceptable and is such I would of preferred a standard king room.		80001631	Michelle Berning	
3224613	50001514	I find the shower, clothing storage area, sink and similar items so very well suited for people that need them, but they are just not well suited for me and I feel bad too that I'm using a room that someone else that came in after me might need.				
3224613	50001515	The only other minor complaint were the quality of the towels, the low to desk height ratio of the desk chair and not having a continuous fan option on the heating & cooling system.				
3224613	50001516	All in all, quite nice				
3224613	50001517	and I would recommend a stay here.				

3293245	50001520	Saturday evening drinks ---SEP---		80001642	Dear lilleykz, Firstly, thank you for taking the time to write your review.	
3293245	50001521	Visited here early Saturday evening drinks with my husband and teenage granddaughter and her friend, prior to family gathering.		80001643	I‚Äôm very sorry to read your feedback on the bar environment and disappointed that the service was only found to be ‚Äòadequate‚Äô.	
3293245	50001522	The service at the bar was adequate however this was the coldest environment I have ever had a drink in, the drinks were expensive and the lager flat!		80001644	I‚Äôm also sorry and surprised with negative feedback on the beer; all our craft ales do receive lots of compliments, some, like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale are not as gassy as a regular beer.	
3293245	50001523	There doesn't seem to be any dress code as people were lounging around in jogging bottoms and skimpy shorts and training vests!		80001645	Although I‚Äôm sorry if there was more of an individual issue with your beverage on your time of visit.	
3293245	50001524	REALLY!		80001646	I have fed this feedback to the management of this area of the business.	
3293245	50001525	I'm not a snob but you pay premium price for some comfort and ambiance and this was severely lacking in the bar area!		80001647	As you mentioned we don‚Äôt have an official dress code, however it is rare that we see people unsuitably dressed and I do apologise if on this occasion this was the case and it effected your evening negatively.	
3293245	50001526	Set some standards and people will happily visit who aren't residents in the hotel!		80001648	Once again thank you for taking the time to write your review.	
3293245				80001649	Kind regards, Richard Lockstone General Manager.	

3267259	50001530	The Amity Horror ---SEP---		80001650	I have recently taken ownership of the motel and am determined to create a great value 3.5 and 4 star star product that meets and hopefully exceeds expectations .	
3267259	50001531	My sister and I had the misfortune of staying there for 2 nights in September and what an experience it was.		80001651	I see that you were very unhappy with the hotel in the past and reading your comments had a right to be.	
3267259	50001532	Where do I start.		80001652	If you are heading back down to Albany for any reason please let me offer you two nights free in our corporate or courtyard rooms.	
3267259	50001533	The 'gentleman' who took my phone booking was abrubt and rude.		80001653	Please then be extremely critical and give us your toughest assessment.	
3267259	50001534	He seemed to find it difficult to understand English and took for ever to place the booking.		80001654	I would love to know your honest opinion now of our hotel.	
3267259	50001535	He even wanted to charge me an extra $15 per night for separate beds!		80001655	Please call us directly on 08 9841 2200 and confirm that David Huang has authorized this comp stay.	
3267259	50001536	The room was smelly and had suspicious wet stains on the carpet.		80001656	Hope you will take up this offer.	
3267259	50001537	The front door didn't close unless you took a flying leap at it from a distance (we came back to the room after being out all day and the door had been left open by the cleaners (probably because they couldn't close it!), and the 'soap dispenser' which was empty, was soap/shampoo/conditioner in one?!				
3267259	50001538	The light over the mirror was broken and the air con was about 30yrs old.				
3267259	50001539	We were reluctant to turn it on in fear of what might fly out of it.				

3315783	50001540	Would DEFINITELY stay here again!		80001667	Thank-you so much for staying with us and we appreciate your review on Tripadvisor!	
3315783	50001541	---SEP---		80001668	We hope you will stay with us again on your next visit to the springs!	
3315783	50001542	I was very happy with my stay at Microtel!		80001669	Hunter Winegardner Front Desk Manager	
3315783	50001543	We usually stay at another hotel in Colorado Springs when we vacation in Colorado, but I saw the ad in the AAA book for this one, and they had a fantastic special going on!				
3315783	50001544	We got the room for $40 less per night than the other hotel, plus it was listed as brand new!				
3315783	50001545	It was VERY nice.				
3315783	50001546	Large room, with bed area separated from sitting area by a kitchen type open countertop; which had fridge and microwave and SINK ; sitting area had sofa,coffeetable, plus another square table with chairs.				
3315783	50001547	In the bed area, there was a nice size computer desk; and the window had a large cushioned windowseat that could be used for a bed.				
3315783	50001548	Behind the bed the wall was mirrorred...made the room feel bigger!				
3315783	50001549	There were nightstands built into the wall on either side of bed.				
3315783	50001550	TV was OK....was high up on wall (not a flatscreen) and could be seen from bed or couch, although was more between both instead of in front of one or the other.				
3315783	50001551	We rarely turn on TV when we are on vacation...				
3315783	50001552	so not an issue!				
3315783	50001553	Very quiet in room, nice BR.				
3315783	50001554	Very clean.				
3315783	50001555	Staff nice and helpful...recommended eating at Texas T Bone, which was not too far, and VERY good!				
3315783	50001556	Breakfast was ok...had wafflemaker, usual toast/cereals/pastries, hard boiled eggs, etc They set up extra tables in lobby for breakfast; not a huge area, but more than some.				
3315783	50001557	Didn't use the pool; it wasn't very big as I recall, but looked clean.				
3315783	50001558	We will stay here again!!				

3184880	50001560	Pretty ordinary ---SEP---		80001670	Thanks for your comments.	
3184880	50001561	I would rate this as a 3 star motel - hardly the four star hotel as indicated on some sites.		80001671	At Best Western Ascot we pride ourselves in excellent customer service and clean rooms.	
3184880	50001562	I suppose you expect the loud highway noise, but as others have said, you also get the noise from adjacent rooms with thin walls.		80001672	We have not used any deodorants for over 6 months and only use a basic multi cleaning agent mixed to the suppliers recommended specifications that does contain disenfectant which is used to clean the bathrooms and kitchen areas.	
3184880	50001563	Taxi charged $20 from domestic airport - hard to find entrance among all the roadworks.		80001673	By telling us what you liked about your stay, you are helping us to give a better experience for you and other guests in the future. . .	
3184880	50001564	No shuttle available.		80001674	Unfortunately the road widing is something we can not control and the works currently under way affects all business's along the Highway and the inconvenience will be for over 12 months.	
3184880	50001565	Nose is assaulted by the strong chemical cleaning fluid/deodorant.		80001675	Once the works are completed it will faster and easier access to the airport and shops.	
3184880	50001566	Despite many reviewers objecting to this, the management replies that 'one of these improvements is the way we present our apartments for each guest arrival with the use of cleaning chemicals and deodorisers.'		80001676	All works are completed Monday to Friday during day light hours only At Ascot there is several shops and restaurants with-in walking distance to have a meal or to purchase such things as groceries or just a loaf of bread	
3184880	50001567	Why don't they listen to customers?				
3184880	50001568	I spent 15 minutes trying to get the TV to work (not helped by inaccurate information in guestbook) and then nearly an hour trying to get a connection to the internet (no wifi) - broken cable, new cable didn't connect - finally advised by reception that it didn't work with Macs.				
3184880	50001569	(A notice to this effect would alleviate the frustration of Mac users.)				
3184880	50001570	No decent food nearby (Chinese restaurant across the road if you want to brave the non-stop traffic and roadworks).				
3184880	50001571	"15"" pizza delivered for $31 plus $2.60 for extra toppings plus $5 delivery fee."				
3184880	50001572	Breakfast pack (packet of cereal, quarter-size muesli bar, tub of tinned fruit, small juice carton) for $11.				
3184880	50001573	Adequate kitchenette (if you have a car to go and find groceries).				
3184880	50001574	Bathroom large enough, but only because there is no vanity (just a tiny hand basin - where do guests put wash bag, cosmetics bag, etc?) and no shower recess (the shower is enclosed only by a shower curtain, spilling into the bathroom floor).				
3184880	50001575	Slippery tiles in shower.				
3184880	50001576	Cheap bathroom fittings.				
3184880	50001577	Toilet didn't flush.				
3184880	50001578	No wardrobe (just clothes rack).				
3184880	50001579	Skimpy pillows and hard mattress.				
3184880	50001580	At least I was given a ground floor room to save me from struggling up the stairs with two suitcases.				
3184880	50001581	Yes, it's close to the airport - but might be worth paying a bit more for a taxi or shuttle to somewhere else.				

3208260	50001590	Awesome!!		80001687	Dear Carla C We love hearing from our guests and are so happy to read your family holiday was one of the best you've had - high praise indeed!	
3208260	50001591	---SEP---		80001688	Family time is so precious and we love it when we hear families who have created real memories.	
3208260	50001592	Although a little over budget, this trip was one of our best family trips taken!!		80001689	We never tire of the wildlife here, it is amazing to see and it sounds as though our positioning statement 'Relax.	
3208260	50001593	The kids had a ball with all the free activities and animal sightings, and mum and dad were both active, yet relaxed at the same time.		80001690	Rejuvenate.	
3208260	50001594	Great resort with lots of things to do.		80001691	Activate' is certainly what you all achieved during your stay.	
3208260	50001595	The mountian bike riding is awesome too!		80001692	Thank you for taking the time to post your review, it is much appreciated and had been shared with the team.	
3208260	50001596	Look forward to returning!		80001693	We look forward to welcoming you and your family back soon and in the meantime please feel free to join us on Facebook and or Twitter where we regularly post updates on happenings at the Resort or new deals just released.

3217391	50001600	Not impressed ---SEP---		80001705	Hello, thankyou for your review.	
3217391	50001601	Booked one of the apartments that had 2 Queens and 1 single which was sufficient for our needs.		80001706	Well we are so sorry that the upgrade was not appreciated as we thought it might have been.	
3217391	50001602	"Arrived to be told we had been upgraded to the ""really nice"" apartment that had 1 King, 1 Queen and 1 single."		80001707	We try our best to provide the best accommodation, there is now a wall mirror to assist with guests needs.	
3217391	50001603	Awesome and off we went with our directions to the apartment which is just behind the Motor Lodge.		80001708	We would just like to let you know that the apartments are not council flats and have never been.	
3217391	50001604	We were told that the apartments don't look much from the outside.		80001709	Perhaps you might stay with us again during a more uplifting trip to New Plymouth.	
3217391	50001605	Boy, that was accurate.				
3217391	50001606	First impressions....council units coupled with what looked like permanent residents, albeit unobtrusive and quiet residents.				
3217391	50001607	Walked through the front door to be greeted by sodden carpet which we had to walk through for 2 days.				
3217391	50001608	It looked like the shower had overflowed from the previous user and leaked through to the next room.				
3217391	50001609	Cleaners had obviously tried to soak the excess up but was still very very wet.				
3217391	50001610	Couldn't avoid walking through it as it covered a large area between the front door and the lounge.				
3217391	50001611	Am surprised that Management allowed the apartment to be let out actually especially considering the over inflated pricing.				
3217391	50001612	Apartments are spacious and reasonably clean but cleaners really need to address the spiders on the ceilings.				
3217391	50001613	Had a rather largish spider trying to climb into my luggage!				
3217391	50001614	Flies were another problem.				
3217391	50001615	Yes I concede flies are particularly bad at this time of the year but a can of fly spray in the kitchen cupboard would have been helpful.				
3217391	50001616	Last negative....only 1 small mirror above the bathroom vanity to share with potentially 5 people.				
3217391	50001617	Please consider putting a full length mirror in at least one of the bedrooms or hallway.				
3217391	50001618	We were attending a funeral and 4 people trying to get ready was a shambles.				
3217391	50001619	Was quiet enough though				
3217391	50001620	so we did sleep well.				
3217391	50001621	I will most definitely be looking at other options next time however.				
3217391	50001622	"I wonder what the apartment was like that we were ""upgraded"" from."				

3310625	50001630	Grandparent during school holidays ---SEP---		80001710	Dear Geraldine H, Thank you for reviewing our hotel.	
3310625	50001631	Wonderful being close to all amenities for children to experience		80001711	I am thrilled you and your grand children enjoyed your stay with us.	
3310625	50001632	Wellington. room clean, breakfast devine, service excellent.		80001712	I will be sure to pass on you kind words about our service and breakfast to the team, we love to hear positive feedback.	
3310625	50001633	Room was noisy from other occupants above us, however overall an enjoyable stay and positive experience.		80001713	Kind Regards Oliver Woods Assistant Hotel Manager	

3244201	50001640	Brief stay; excellent value ---SEP---		80001724	Dear Joanna B, Many thanks for your gracious review.	
3244201	50001641	My husband and I booked in here last minute, as the hotel where we were attending a wedding was charging extortionate rates for a shabby room.		80001725	I'm glad that overall your stay with us was an enjoyable one and that you found the accommodation well priced and relaxing.	
3244201	50001642	After a minor misunderstanding regarding check in was dealt with swiftly and efficiently by the pleasant night staff; we were pleased to find our room spacious and spotlessly clean, with comfortable bed and excellent shower.		80001726	We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	
3244201	50001643	Only minor complaint was no cups left out for tea/ coffee.,		80001727	Kind regards, George O'Gara General Manager	
3244201	50001644	Also have stayed in a few different travelodges and found noise to be an issue , but not so at Travelodge Airport South-				
3244201	50001645	it was extremely quiet and peaceful.				
3244201	50001646	Secure Car park was a bonus.				
3244201	50001647	Hassle free , relaxing accommodation at an excellent price , in a handy area.				

3181749	50001650	Mostly good ---SEP---		80001738	Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback from which we were were pleased to hear that you had enjoyed your visit.	
3181749	50001651	I have returned from a coach break in the north east staying at the Gosforth Park Hotel.		80001739	Overall the feedback from everyone on the tour was very positive and we were pleased to be of service to you all.	
3181749	50001652	I have not lived in the NE for a long time and was excited about staying in the hotel which was 'the place to go to years ago', Mostly I was not disappoined.		80001740	We do hope that you have the opportunity to return once again.	
3181749	50001653	Without exception the staff were lovely and went out of their way to help in every way.				
3181749	50001654	As I was on a coach trip we all had to eat at 6.30 and had a limited menu.				
3181749	50001655	The starters and deserts were fine, the main courses maybe were not the standard I had hoped for.				
3181749	50001656	I hope to return independantly in the future to benefit from the hotel's usual guest menu.				
3181749	50001657	We did have a very extensive beakfast buffet which was excellent.				

3288045	50001660	Very Disappointed ---SEP--- Had booked a 4 night stay Our accommodation turned out to be Room 41 which was a 2 bed/2 bathroom apartment above the site offices and Thai restaurant.		80001751	Dear Guests The unit style booked was the unit style as selected by yourselves.	
3288045	50001661	Room 1 was ensuite showe/bath and toilet and Room 2 had a bathroom next to it with a shower and toilet.		80001752	This review is a gross misrepresentation.	
3288045	50001662	Upon arrival at the resort first impressions were good at first but once we were directed to the access to the apartment things changed.		80001753	Regards Management	
3288045	50001663	We were shown to the back door ie the service area, where the stairs to our door were in between the public toilets and then on the other side next to the back of a Thai restaurant which was spilling over on to the path which was badly hidden by a very big palm in a pot, shelves stacked with pans and boxes and 3 Coles shopping trolleys and a bicycle and the ground was covered in grease stains, not a good impression.				
3288045	50001664	Upon entering the foyer had a bad smell.				
3288045	50001665	We then entered the apartment.				
3288045	50001666	We were surprised as to how small it was and the condition of the walls was a bit shocking, in need of a well overdue paint job, the areas that had been patched were badly done.				
3288045	50001667	Only air conditioning in one bedroom and lounge area none in the other bedroom however there was a fan in the cupboard.				
3288045	50001668	The 2nd bathroom shower leaked water all over the floor obviously a fault with the seal.				
3288045	50001669	When mentioned to the caretaker she stated it always happens and would we like some more towels to mop it up!				
3288045	50001670	The other bathroom faired worse as it was a plastic shower hose over the bath which just would not work properly.				
3288045	50001671	As soon as you got hot water it went cold and vice versa , no amount of adjusting made it work properly, it was impossible to have a bath as the water flow was so slow it would have taken the whole night to fill the bath .				
3288045	50001672	The shower curtain was just that bit too small to reach the side of the bath so water just poured out all over the floor.				
3288045	50001673	The laundry line over the bath was hanging down the wall and the unit was actually hanging off the wall and it was unusable as you could not pull it out and looked tardy.				
3288045	50001674	The toilet cistern once flushed just did not stop filling up and the water was running continuously.				
3288045	50001675	Regarding the cleanliness the cupboards were badly smeared and the bedroom wardrobe and shelves had a layer of dust in the bottom as well as the mirrors were badly smeared.				
3288045	50001676	The curtain rail was hanging off the wall on the right hand side as the fitting was missing, all the the ropes and buttons on the Venetian blinds were dirty and majority of the knobs were broken.				
3288045	50001677	The pool was dated and old and the water was dirty and cold.				
3288045	50001678	We brought all this to the attention to the management who said they would deal with it all, but by the time we returned only the toilet had been fixed.				
3288045	50001679	To cap it all off on the morning of our third day at 6:15am, a massive lorry pulled up outside our side wall and kept running its engine until 09:30, so loud it impossible to sleep and filling the appartement with toxic fumes.				
3288045	50001680	At 9 am I went to the office and expressed my annoyance at the lorry to which I was told that it was not their problem as it was next door!				
3288045	50001681	I explained that least they could do is have a word and that surely they must have had warning!				
3288045	50001682	They said that only three days before had they been informed that these works would start and can you believe for 18 months, building a 5 storey hotel!				
3288045	50001683	They agreed that the lorry should not have started work until 7 am as agreed by the coyncil				
3288045	50001684	but they were not prepared to do anything about it !				
3288045	50001685	Basically tough !				
3288045	50001686	She explained that we only had one night left so it would be ok !!, I DESPAIR!				
3288045	50001687	These people have no idea of what customer service is, in the end I wanted to know how we stood if we left that morning could we get our money back				
3288045	50001688	and she said they would contact the owners but were hesitant to contact them as if asked the owners to do something that they would get in trouble!				
3288045	50001689	Eventually however they agreed to refund the last night and we checked out.				
3288045	50001690	The accommodation cost $1440 for 4 nights !				
3288045	50001691	Please be aware that here on in anyone who is offered this room should refuse it or stay elsewhere, they need to invest into the apartment and bear in mind the fact that there will be building works for 18 months right next door.				
3288045	50001692	The only good thing the place had going for it was the location as it was central to the shops.				
3288045	50001693	From the discussion we had and reading the past reviews and responses from management on Trip Advisor, It would appear that management have lost their grip on reality as the responses we and other people got, were just unacceptable.				

3253174	50001700	I wish there were a higher rating possible ---SEP---		80001764	Thank you for posting such a glowing review and the title!	
3253174	50001701	Hands down, this was the most pleasant hotel experience ever.		80001765	We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with us and the team looked after you well - we are very much looking forward to welcoming you back.	
3253174	50001702	From a no-problem early check in to an invitation to relax in the executive lounge after checking out while waiting for a delayed daughter to arrive, every member of staff was cheerful, professional, and helpful.		80001766	B.	
3253174	50001703	The room was comfortable, food excellent, and in the best location possible when visiting London.				
3253174	50001704	But again, it‚Äôs the staff....doorman recommended the perfect pub, the bellman tended my bags after checkout so we could visit that pub, and every time we entered or left the hotel, we were greeted warmly and treated like family.				
3253174	50001705	Can you tell that I love this hotel?				

3311724	50001710	Central location, faultless in every respect ---SEP---		80001777	Thank you for your kind recognition of our fantastic team and for your high recommendation!

3257681	50001722	I'd give hem 10 stars if it were possible.		80001782	The upside to this is that automatically the property and Mantra brand get the recognition from this experience due to our team.	
3257681	50001723	If we didn't live so far away(western Australia) we'd be regular visitors, but we do hope to return some day.		80001783	I hope we do get to see you again for another great experience and if I can assist in making that happen liaise with me directly luke.harley@mantra.com.au

3163923	50001751	I was so so grateful for this.				
3163923	50001752	The manager stood talking to us for a while at breakfast and is such a lovely guy and a fantastic manager.				
3163923	50001753	Also got given a wee millionare shortcake the night before as a happy birthday.				
3163923	50001754	I can't thank this hotel enough for such a wondeful stay!

3174472	50001804	My kids and I stayed over the New Years Eve (a few days before and a day after.		80001861	Till the next time!	
3174472	50001805	It was also my son's sixth birthday.		80001862	Edwin Martinez 807-473-2456	
3174472	50001806	We were a bit under the weather when we arrived and they'd put three gingerales in our fridge.				
3174472	50001807	I had requested and was accommodated with a room with a view of the Norwesters.				
3174472	50001808	We upgraded to the family suite for New Years and also rented the steam bath.				
3174472	50001809	The room and the steam bath were just amazing.				
3174472	50001810	We had our own balcony and a view of the stars and mountains.				
3174472	50001811	It was exactly as I remembered growing up and wanted my kids near those mountains for the holidays.				
3174472	50001812	I would definitely come back again.				
3174472	50001813	The food at the restaurant was well priced and fresh.				
3174472	50001814	The pickerel was delicious.				
3174472	50001815	The hotel caters well to children and they felt right at home.				
3174472	50001816	I used to travel for a living and have stayed in four and five star hotels around the world.				
3174472	50001817	I was given the most personalized and considerate service I can ever remember.				
3174472	50001818	Thank you for making our stay so memorable.				
3174472	50001819	The kids learned that when staying out we respect our environment the same as if we were at home.				
3174472	50001820	It was a stress free holiday and although it was too cold at -50				
3174472	50001821	Celsius to ski we were very cozy in the pool, jacuzzi, sauna, pool and steambath.				
3174472	50001822	We were able to recharge and get back to my Finn- Swede roots.				

3286303	50001830	Really Nice Spot ---SEP---		80001873	Dear Calgaryguy, Thank you for the great review of our hotel!	
3286303	50001831	I'll admit it.		80001874	We are glad that you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again very soon.	
3286303	50001832	We were spoiled as we got upgraded to a suite, likely because a tour bus was arriving the same day.		80001875	Sincerely, Kenneth Belleperche Manager of Business Retention & Social Media	
3286303	50001833	Easy check in.				
3286303	50001834	Very spacious and if we were staying for a few days, the amenities in the suite would really suit us.				
3286303	50001835	Comfortable bed, good lighting, and quiet!				
3286303	50001836	Not as close to the downtown as some might wish, but that is an individual choice.				
3286303	50001837	Glad we chose this spot.				

3285231	50001840	Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach ---SEP---		80001886	Thank you for the review and candid remarks; I am pleased to read that you enjoyed the stay.	
3285231	50001841	We recently stayed at this hotel prior to a cruise with Royal Caribbean.		80001887	It sounds like there was some opportunity with your check-in experience.	
3285231	50001842	The hotel was presented well, the rooms were nice and breakfast was excellent.		80001888	I will share your comments with the team for further review.	
3285231	50001843	The staff member that dealt with us at the desk was not fantastic though, we had booked as a couple (on our honeymoon)		80001889	We hope you can return soon at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort!	
3285231	50001844	but unfortunately he put us in a twin room instead of a king.		80001890	Regards.	
3285231	50001845	We queried this explaining that we didn't want separate beds especially since we had our young child with us who may end up in our bed if she woke during the night.				
3285231	50001846	The staff member didn't seem to see the problem and told us that there were no other rooms.				
3285231	50001847	Luckily we were able to swap rooms with other family members travelling with us and resolved the issue ourselves.				

3245581	50001850	Beautiful hotel ---SEP---		80001901	We take great pride in delivering the highest level of service and appreciate you acknowledging our team‚Äôs hard work.	
3245581	50001851	Stay here once a year for business.		80001902	Thank you for sharing your review on TripAdvisor and for your glowing recommendation.	
3245581	50001852	Staff is wonderful.		80001903	We will look forward to welcoming you back for another memorable stay soon!	
3245581	50001853	Rooms are spacious, comfortable, and quiet.				
3245581	50001854	My husband sleeps better here than at home.				
3245581	50001855	Love their toiletries too.				
3245581	50001856	Always a pleasant experience.				

3169488	50001860	Very pleasant hotel ---SEP--- Clean large room with easy free parking and friendly staff.		80001914	Dear B6420STpeterb, Thank you so much for having taken the time to share your feedback following your recent stay at the Future Inns with the TripAdvisor community.	
3169488	50001861	A 10 minute walk to the train station for a one stop service to Cardiff Queen Street station in the city centre.		80001915	We are pleased to read that you had an enjoyable stay with us and we truly hope we will have the opportunity to exceed your expectations on your return visit.	
3169488	50001862	Plenty of chain type restaraunt and bars near the hotel in Cardiff Bay.		80001916	Warmest regards, Przemek Kaminski	

3170133	50001870	Beautiful Property, Sub-Par Service ---SEP--- .I will start this review by saying that both the Palazzo and attached Venetian are beautiful, well-appointed resort/casinos.		80001927	Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing The Venetian|The Palazzo as your host during your recent visit.	
3170133	50001871	They have a huge amount of amenities that rival anywhere else in Vegas.		80001928	We are humbled to have received your insightful comments, for there really is no greater way to better our services than by receiving truly vital feedback from a valued guest.	
3170133	50001872	Resort: Large and centrally located on the strip.		80001929	While I am pleased that your stay was positive overall, I apologize for the lack of personalized service that you experienced.	
3170133	50001873	Rooms: All suites, but you can upgrade or tip at the front desk for bigger room or better view.		80001930	Providing unmatched individualized service is a hallmark of our standards here at the resort and I am disheartened that you did not experience this during your stay.	
3170133	50001874	Service:		80001931	I am glad you have notified us so we can acknowledge your experience and use your comments to improve our service.	
3170133	50001875	In my experience it was poor.		80001932	Should you wish to further discuss the details of your visit, we invite you to contact our Guest Relations Department directly.	
3170133	50001876	A few main complaints: no wi-fi in room despite being charged resort fee which included this (they removed resort fee upon learning this on checkout).		80001933	It is our sincere hope that you will give us another opportunity to exceed your expectations on a future visit.	
3170133	50001877	Room was asked to be cleaned at 9am...		80001934	Kind Regards, Kirsten Dimond VP of Hotel Operations	
3170133	50001878	we asked for them to come back at 10, but they never did all day.				
3170133	50001879	Room service was spotty at times, one breakfast was great and one time i ordered late night it didn't show up for almost 2 hours.				
3170133	50001880	Casino:				
3170133	50001881	Good selection of tables (starting at $15 from what I saw), nice variety of slots and a cool sportsbook, but that is off the main casino downstairs.				
3170133	50001882	Dining: Very good!				
3170133	50001883	We had brunch at Morel's one day and loved it.				
3170133	50001884	Grand Lux was good for lunch on the day of our departure and probably the best value I saw in Vegas.				
3170133	50001885	Pool:				
3170133	50001886	We went a cabana at Azure one day and it was cool.				
3170133	50001887	Was it worth the minimum $1500 spend when a bottle of Absolut is worth $400?				
3170133	50001888	Well, I suppose that matters what you are interested in.				
3170133	50001889	Being married and in my thirties it didn't really justify the cost for our group to me.				
3170133	50001890	Shopping:				
3170133	50001891	A lot of high end stores.				
3170133	50001892	In retrospect it was probably good we spent the day at Azure otherwise my wife my have done more damage in the shopping area.				
3170133	50001893	Price:				
3170133	50001894	On par with any of the other new, luxury properties on the strip.				
3170133	50001895	Overall, I would stay here again, but I left with a little sour taste based on the service portion.				
3170133	50001896	Granted i am used to staying at smaller Hiltons on a weekly basis where good service is standard.				
3170133	50001897	This is a 7000 or so room resort with a focus on gaming, so I understand that me wanting to check my ipad isn't high on their priority list				

3302189	50001900	Great weeks holiday ---SEP---		80001945	Thank you for your review KGB, I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us and hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back again soon.

3302189	50001902	The position is great, only a ten minute walk to the seafront and pier.		80001947	Book direct - 01202 298020	
3302189	50001903	My room was a decent size and the shower was spacious and powerful.		80001948	- we guarantee the lowest prices and it ensures you get the room and the bath or shower that you want.	
3302189	50001904	breakfast was plentiful and service polite and speedy.		80001949	Our standard rooms average 135 sq ft., balcony rooms now fully air-conditioned, average 155 sq ft, superiors without balconies 175 sq ft,Executives 210 sq.ft and Suites 250 sq ft.	
3302189	50001905	The swimming pool is great, quite large for the UK and it had a hot tub too.				
3302189	50001906	Totally recommend üëç				

3310372	50001910	Four star with Fine Dining it is not ---SEP---		80001950	Dear TwoTravelBugsToo, Thank you for taking the time to write this review.	
3310372	50001911	We stayed here during our 4 day visit to beautiful Banff.		80001951	We are disappointed to know that you did not enjoy your stay with us.	
3310372	50001912	The hotel is at the end of the main street away from the shops and eateries.		80001952	The restaurant has received a lot of positive feedback particularly for dinner, so it is unfortunate this was not your experience.	
3310372	50001913	The room was comfortable and quiet.		80001953	Allow me to apologize for the sheets as this is definitely not our standard of service and will be addressed with the team to ensure it is rectified immediately moving forward.	
3310372	50001914	Four star with fine dining the hotel is not!		80001954	Once again, thank you for your feedback.	
3310372	50001915	We ate in on our first night.		80001955	Sincerely, Suzanne Gittens General Manager	
3310372	50001916	The restaurant has little character or ambiance.				
3310372	50001917	The unsmiling waitress kept pushing her hair behind her ears as she served.				
3310372	50001918	Food is pretty average, although with fancy descriptions.				
3310372	50001919	One day on our return to the hotel at 16:30 our room had yet to be serviced.				
3310372	50001920	The floor supervisor pointed out that they had been busy.				
3310372	50001921	The room staff came and completely changed the bed - needless as we were leaving the next day.				
3310372	50001922	That evening as we went to bed we saw that both the top & bottom sheets had small tears all over.				
3310372	50001923	We informed the front desk next morning.				
3310372	50001924	This hotel is essentially alright, but needs to considerably up its game.				

3177973	50001930	Great stay ---SEP---		80001966	Hi Doodles6!	
3177973	50001931	Just been for a second visit to the hostel and have to say there‚Äôs been some nice changes made to it.		80001967	Thanks for your review - yes we have made a few changes over winter and its always extra satisfying when our returning guests like them!	
3177973	50001932	The main one is the dining/cafe area.		80001968	There will be other small but much needed changes coming up - I hope to meet you on a return visit.	
3177973	50001933	It‚Äôs been recently decorated and now serves meals/cakes/coffees/ bottles alcohol, beers wine etc.		80001969	Regards Simon & Team Whitby	
3177973	50001934	It has a for more relaxed feel with high tables and chairs, soft sofa style chairs and standard table and chairs to eat at.				
3177973	50001935	We used this area for a couple of drinks on an evening and we ate breakfast there the following day.				
3177973	50001936	(Breakfast was great, various cereal, juices, toast, cooked breakfast and teas and coffee. ).				
3177973	50001937	It‚Äôs completely lost the canteen feel and is a lovely area to enjoy.				
3177973	50001938	The staff at the hostel were very friendly, chatty and helpful.				
3177973	50001939	Couldn‚Äôt fault them.				
3177973	50001940	I will definitely be visiting here again and can recommend it.				

3204246	50001950	Perfect! ---SEP---		80001970	Wow!	
3204246	50001951	A wonderful hotel - highly recommended!		80001971	now that is a heading that we all love to see, thank you.	
3204246	50001952	Beautiful building and decorating on the inside.		80001972	I am delighted that you enjoyed every element of your stay with us and that you will only consider Villa Magdala when returning to Bath, that is lovely to read.	
3204246	50001953	Furnished to a very high standard.		80001973	Thank you also for sharing your photographs, I love the one of the pumpkins on the step, we had much fun that weekend with the pumpkin competition and were delighted that our guests took such an active role in being judges!	
3204246	50001954	We were given a warm welcome by the owner who arranged for us to have tea and cake complimentary on arrival in the beautiful restaurant.		80001974	We very much look forward to welcoming you back and please do book directly with myself so i can take care of your booking personally.	
3204246	50001955	The owner helped us plan our day in bath.		80001975	King regards, Caroline	
3204246	50001956	Our room was large, clean and beautiful.				
3204246	50001957	Little chocolates and a welcome note on the bed- huge comfy bed- giant TV with Netflix and catch-up!				
3204246	50001958	Bathroom worked well and had nice toiletries.				
3204246	50001959	The best part was breakfast!				
3204246	50001960	Buck's Fizz, cereals, pastries, tea coffee, fresh juice, smoothie, fantastic choice of cooked meals - all of which were delicious.				
3204246	50001961	Adequate car parking spaces.				
3204246	50001962	Wonderful and friendly hosts.				
3204246	50001963	Perfect location 8 min walk to bath centre!!				
3204246	50001964	Would definitely recommend and would never stay elsewhere if returning to bath.				

3316217	50001970	Anniversary stay ---SEP---		80001986	Dear Jade-orch Thank you for your review and a belated happy anniversary.	
3316217	50001971	My dad booked a room through his business for myself and my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.		80001987	I am so pleased the team took it upon themselves to look after you and go the extra mile for your special occasion.	
3316217	50001972	The room was big with a view over the stadium and the river.		80001988	We look forward to seeing you again soon hopefully Kind regards Richard Platts General Manager	
3316217	50001973	I mentioned that it was our anniversary and reception sent up a bottle of wine to room which was a lovely touch.				
3316217	50001974	The location is amazing, right next to all shops and bars etc.				
3316217	50001975	The park across the road was beautiful and you can catch a boat into Cardiff bay.				
3316217	50001976	In the morning the breakfast was lovely and I was full up for the day.				
3316217	50001977	We will stay here again when visiting Cardiff!				

3177945	50001980	Location is everything ---SEP---		80001999	Thank you for your comments.	
3177945	50001981	This hotel is very convenient for airport travellers but offers very little else.		80002000	Yes we are certainly close to the terminal	
3177945	50001982	It seems the hotel is still settling in.		80002001	but we definitely don‚Äôt expect to trade on this point alone.	
3177945	50001983	Room service was reasonably priced but short on options.		80002002	We look forward to welcoming you back in the future and hope you will see some of the exciting changes we are planning.	
3177945	50001984	A children's menu would be a good addition.		80002003	Kind Regards, Tish Nyar General Manager	
3177945	50001985	The rooms are small but adequate.				
3177945	50001986	We had interconnecting rooms but found no easy way to leave the doors open between the rooms.				
3177945	50001987	The foyer is very sterile and not very welcoming with people waiting in queues.				
3177945	50001988	There were no bathrobes or scuffs which is very unusual in an airport hotel at this price.				
3177945	50001989	These would also be a good addition.				
3177945	50001990	Concierge service was a bit slow but very helpful.				
3177945	50001991	They have airport luggage trolleys at the hotel but you need to ask.				
3177945	50001992	I would stay there again prior to an early morning flight, you can't beat it for convenience.				

3297207	50002000	Matenence worker enterered my room ---SEP---		80002014	Dear geraldinec808, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at Travelodge Docklands.	
3297207	50002001	As i just finishing my shower i hear Someone walk in my room i yelled out who is it hes like im sorry and walks out i called reception to complain but never heard back from them not even an apology ..		80002015	I was very disappointed to read that you did not have had a pleasurable stay with us this time.	
3297207				80002016	I will assure you that this matter will be escalated to our management and will address the both departments.	
3297207				80002017	Should you wish to discuss your stay further, please do not hesitate to contact us directly on +61 8615 1000.	
3297207				80002018	Kind Regards, Charith Kapurubandara Duty Manager	

3322185	50002010	You'll feel welcome and appreciated at the Roxy ---SEP--- Stayed at the Roxy last weekend and had a truly great experience.		80002029	Dear ginaing, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay at The Roxy on TripAdvisor.	
3322185	50002011	This was not my first time at the Roxy (formerly the Tribeca Grand) and everything was as wonderful as I remembered.		80002030	We are happy to learn our team was able to enhance your stay.	
3322185	50002012	The staff are very welcoming and accommodating, always smiling and going out of their way to make guests feel valued.		80002031	We are happy that you enjoyed the hotel‚Äôs d√©cor and live music at The Django Jazz club.	
3322185	50002013	You can't help but feel appreciated here.		80002032	During your next visit, we encourage you to enjoy popcorn and a movie in our Cinema where we offer complimentary admission to our hotel guests.	
3322185	50002014	I forgot my phone charger and the front desk was quick to find one for me.		80002033	We hope to see you again soon.	
3322185	50002015	My very early arrival was accommodated with very little delay (just long enough to get a coffee in the excellent lobby coffee bar, Jack's,).		80002034	Kind Regards, Sami Rahman	
3322185	50002016	I requested a few extra things up to the room and they brought everything up within 10 minutes of my calls (frequent travelers will know how astonishing this is).				
3322185	50002017	Our multiple experiences in the lobby bar were memorable (special shout-out to Roland who kept us entertained on a slow Sunday night and made us feel like VIPs).				
3322185	50002018	Beyond the confines of the hotel, you cannot beat the location and the surrounding offerings.				
3322185	50002019	There is a wealth of shopping and dining options in the immediate vicinity; the A/C/E subway is literally at the corner of the hotel and many other lines are nearby; and you can easily walk to many attractions including the Brooklyn Bridge, the World Trade Center, the ferry ports, museums, parks, etc.				
3322185	50002020	We did have one hiccup at the Django (waited a very long time but never received our food, couldn't find any staff to help, and had to eventually abandon our table to search out food elsewhere) but the front desk corrected this error immediately.				
3322185	50002021	And even though the lobby bar had technically stopped serving food, they brought out some fries and drinks to help sate our hunger.				
3322185	50002022	Despite this one problem, I would still try the Django again as the atmosphere is lively and the music is great.				
3322185	50002023	I feel certain this is not a common occurrence and was an aberration.				
3322185	50002024	The hotel has a cool, vintage vibe and a spacious, atrium-style lobby that is perfect for hanging out with others.				
3322185	50002025	The rooms are standard sized for NYC but are well-appointed, as are the bathrooms.				
3322185	50002026	One recommendation if you are a light-sleeper is to bring soft earplugs, as this is a low-rise hotel and you will definitely hear street noise.				
3322185	50002027	And you may also hear the live music from the lobby since its an atrium-style hotel.				
3322185	50002028	But please don't let this scare you away.				
3322185	50002029	I'm an extremely noise-sensitive person and quite particular about my hotel needs, and I think this hotel makes for a wonderful stay.				
3322185	50002030	A little preparation with earplugs goes a long way.				

3289711	50002040	Lovely stay at the Harbour Hotel Galway ---SEP---		80002045	Dear Leticia M, Thank you for your wonderful review!	
3289711	50002041	Our stay was lovely - third time in Galway, always in a different hotel.		80002046	I'm thrilled to hear you had such a great stay, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3289711	50002042	Next time we won't need to look for a different place to stay.		80002047	If I can be of any assistance with future bookings please contact me directly.	
3289711	50002043	Great location and even greater facilities.		80002048	Kind regards, Ali McHugh General Manager ali.mchugh@harbour.ie	
3289711	50002044	Would definitely recommend it.				

3297292	50002050	Great Value and Location ---SEP---		80002059	Thank you for your kind 5 star review and for choosing the Snooze!	
3297292	50002051	I loved the weekend I spent at Snooze hotel.		80002060	It's great to hear when our guests have a great time with us.	
3297292	50002052	It's such a great value - free parking, free use of umbrellas and beach chairs, sunscreen, etc.		80002061	We try to provide everything you need for a fun beach vacation.	
3297292	50002053	The staff was extremely friendly, and the rooftop terrace CANNOT be beat.		80002062	We supply what you need, you create the fun memories!	
3297292				80002063	We hope to see you again here in south Florida.	
3297292				80002064	Thanks again for your kind words!	
3297292				80002065	Warm regards, Matt	

3283152	50002060	Not so relaxing spa day!!		80002076	Thank you for your review.	
3283152	50002061	---SEP---		80002077	I have spoken with our Spa Manager, who has acknowledged your review.	
3283152	50002062	To whom it may concern, I visited your spa facilities on Saturday the 27th May, this day was planned for the celebration of my sister's up-and-coming wedding day.		80002078	Please rest assured that once investigated, he will contact you.	
3283152	50002063	However we left feeling nothing but relaxed.		80002079	Kind regards Wael Elassal	
3283152	50002064	We were greeted by staff of the spa and were told that the treatment we were having was a back, shoulder and neck massage.				
3283152	50002065	I queried this as we had been told that our treatment was a full body aromatherapy massage on the phone previously, this being why we had chose the deal.				
3283152	50002066	The staff member then said that we were right and we had been upgraded.				
3283152	50002067	When our treatment time came we had the same miscommunication problem.				
3283152	50002068	It was thought that we had the shoulder, back and neck massage instead of the full body one.				
3283152	50002069	We were then told by staff that they would massage the back of our legs for this inconvenience.				
3283152	50002070	Whilst in treatment my massage was extremely disappointing, I would go as far as to say the worst I have ever had.				
3283152	50002071	The pressure was not ok throughout				
3283152	50002072	and I was not asked once if it was.				
3283152	50002073	The treatment also did not last for the full 40 minutes as promised and the back of my legs were not massaged.				
3283152	50002074	After the treatment we then proceeded to the bar for some cocktails.				
3283152	50002075	We waited an extensive amount of time to become acknowledged by the bar staff.				
3283152	50002076	Then they proceeded to serve a gentlemen who had not been waiting as long as we had.				
3283152	50002077	When we had finally been served we went and sat within the bar area.				
3283152	50002078	It took 20 minutes for one cocktail to be brought to us, this I thought was very peculiar as we had ordered three.				
3283152	50002079	Another 10-15 minutes went by and we received the other two.				
3283152	50002080	I understand that this was a Saturday and you are very busy, however I was extremely disappointed with the service received both in the spa and bar facilities.				
3283152	50002081	From this experience I have gathered a negative opinion of your hotel and spa and would not recommend to others.

3227156	50002094	The Spa is fantastic and it is great to be able to have a swim after a day's sightseeing.				
3227156	50002095	Highly recommended.				

3298793	50002100	Honeymon ---SEP---		80002094	Aloha louhinaz, Thank you for your having stayed with us during your honeymoon trip.

3247253	50002110	Will definitely be back!		80002100	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for this wonderful review of the Galway Bay Hotel.	
3247253	50002111	---SEP---		80002101	I am delighted to view your comments, and I have shared your views with all on the team.	
3247253	50002112	I recently stayed for 2 nights with my boyfriend in the Galway Bay hotel and I have to say it was a pleasure from start to finish.		80002102	All team members here have asked that I pass on a very sincere Galway Bay Hotel ‚Äòthank you.‚Äô	
3247253	50002113	From the welcoming atmosphere to the excellent service by all the staff it seemed no request was too big.		80002103	You mention Peter in person, he is chuffed (and rightly so) to be mentioned in such a positive light through such a public medium.	
3247253	50002114	Our room was spacious and very clean and the view of the Promenade from our room was lovely and meant we got a good nights sleep also.		80002104	I do agree with your comments regarding our location.	
3247253	50002115	We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first evening and we couldn't find fault with either the quality of the food or value for money!		80002105	We are very close to the city centre, however in a seaside location so people can ‚Äòget the best of both worlds‚Äô whilst relaxing during a well earned break.	
3247253	50002116	The manager Peter was accommodating and answered all of our queries and requests in a professional and friendly manner.		80002106	Also, we are in the ideal location to base oneself when choosing a location to tour the West of Ireland and Connemara; sitting directly on the promenade, overlooking the beautiful Galway Bay and Clare Hills, with Galway city on one side and of course Connemara on the other side.	
3247253	50002117	The hotel is close to the town without giving you the feeling that you're on a city break due to its seaside location.		80002107	As you are only too aware we have the blue flag beach outside our door and this is obviously extremely popular with families and couples alike.	
3247253	50002118	Highly recommend!		80002108	You mention ‚Äòwelcoming atmosphere‚Äô and I am delighted to see this.	
3247253				80002109	As a team, we work very hard to achieve this through our in house structured training program ‚Äì ‚ÄòExceeding Expectations‚Äô ‚Äì with a primary focus on costumer care and costumer service.	
3247253				80002110	I would like to thank you once again and I look forward to welcoming you back to the Galway Bay at some stage in the future.	
3247253				80002111	Please do not hesitate to drop me a line at dmurphy@galwaybayhotel.com	
3247253				80002112	a	
3247253				80002113	I would welcome the opportunity to say hello in person at some stage in the future.	
3247253				80002114	Kindest Regards, Dan Murphy .

3290394				80002130	Kind regards, Simon PS

3279583	50002130	Quick Relaxation Get Away ---SEP---		80002142	John K., We are happy that you and your daughter were able to enjoy the Blackstone Mountain Lodge, and the local Canmore area.	
3279583	50002131	The accommodations were clean, modern and beautiful.		80002143	We find that the retreat to the mountains is a favorite place to come to, while getting away from the city.	
3279583	50002132	The staff very pleasant and professional in providing extra amenities and discounts when available to them which gave my daughter and I a better experience.		80002144	There is an endless amount of possibilities, from adventurous activities, to relaxing moments, and everything in between.	
3279583	50002133	The pricing was excellent for a short trip it made it affordable and will make it a regular stay now when needing to get away from the city.		80002145	I see that you are quite close by, and definitely look forward to having you, and your daughter, as a guest of the resort in the near future once again.	
3279583	50002134	Thank you ever so much John and Talia		80002146	Please give us a call directly as you would qualify for our loyalty discount.	
3279583				80002147	Thank you, Andrew S.	

3215840	50002140	Average hotel, above average service ---SEP---		80002158	Thank you for your review.	
3215840	50002141	I booked this hotel for a business trip to Limerick and after reading the rapturous reviews on here, thought that I'd got an amazing deal for a twin room for two nights for GBP 120 (I think I booked on Expedia or booking.com).		80002159	The hotel is located in the city on the river Shannon (the longest river in Ireland), there is a local working dock beside us and I am glad to hear that it did not cause you too much disturbance.	
3215840	50002142	There are a couple of things I hadn't realised when I booked it (perhaps I hadn't read the reviews quite closely enough)...		80002160	Many of our guests like this area as the dock has some great history attached to it, we even have some information on this in our bedrooms.	
3215840	50002143	Limerick is not a particularly lovely place - I had an image of quite a quaint Irish town for some reason, but quaint it is not.		80002161	I am delighted that you found our hotel team very friendly and that this was a huge positive to your trip.	
3215840	50002144	The hotel is located in a particularly unscenic part of town, opposite an apartment building that is really not very nice and overlooking the river which is just generally grey.		80002162	The sunset on the river is indeed a beautiful site and should be on everybody‚Äôs to do list when they visit.	
3215840	50002145	There is no parking on site and so you have to park in the NCP just around the corner - if you're staying for any longer than one night, it is better value to pay EUR 15 for a one week ticket which will allow you to come and go as you please.		80002163	Should you be visiting this area again, I would appreciate if you contact me directly.	
3215840	50002146	However there is a big positive about this hotel.		80002164	Kind regards, Ivan Tuohy General Manager.	
3215840	50002147	The staff.				
3215840	50002148	They were great, without exception.				
3215840	50002149	Friendly, efficient check in.				
3215840	50002150	Lovely waitress in Kudos, the bar/restaurant.				
3215840	50002151	Really polite guy in the morning who quickly brought extra towels to the room when I called down for them and then helped me with some heavy parcels into my car.				
3215840	50002152	They really can't do enough for you and make this average hotel really good.				
3215840	50002153	The room could do with a make over...the beds were fine - comfortable with clean bedding and nice pillows.				
3215840	50002154	The carpet and curtains have seen better days though and the paintwork is a bit sad.				
3215840	50002155	The bathroom is ok, but on the first morning the shower was rubbish - absolutely no water pressure and lots of air, but the guy who came and brought the towels reported it to maintenance and when I came back to the room in the evening, it was completely different - really good pressure and really hot.				
3215840	50002156	Brilliant.				
3215840	50002157	My mum accompanied me (like I said, we thought Limerick was a nice place that she might like to have a look round while I was working) and she used the sauna and steam room, which she said were nice.				
3215840	50002158	Finally, our room number was 402.				
3215840	50002159	Don't ask for this room unless you particularly want a perfect view of a car wrecking yard.				
3215840	50002160	Work seemed to go on until about 5.30pm so isn't a big disturbance, but it's quite noisy when it is going on.				
3215840	50002161	On the plus side, the sunset over the river was fabulous.				
3215840	50002162	There we are, finished on a positive note!				

3308397	50002170	Wonderful Castle and Enjoyable Break ---SEP--- A mid-week break in early April - it was a wonderful and relaxing experience made great by the efficient and friendly staff in particular Alan in the restaurant who made that extra effort to make the birthday dinner special.		80002175	Dear pmcorcoran Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Lough Rynn Castle Estate & Gardens.

3256762	50002191	---SEP---		80002204	Guest satisfaction is our number one goal and we never want our guests to have anything less than a great stay.	
3256762	50002192	Thank you Windham for the back-ache and foot injury due to a bathroom sink that was extremely low, a very saggy uncomfortable bed, and a tub wall that was incredibly high, but that was actually a good thing to help hold in the water from the tub that didn't drain.		80002205	Your feedback is very important to us, we use it to help train our staff and fix any problems so that we can continue to improve.	
3256762	50002193	The shower curtain was dirty, and by the way, what decent hotel these days doesn't have a curved shower rod?		80002206	Thank you for taking the time to write your response and we do hope you will consider staying with us in the future.	
3256762	50002194	The closet door didn't close, and the room smelled of BO.		80002207	Sincerely, Allison	
3256762	50002195	The hallway was dark and a little scary.				
3256762	50002196	Thank you				
3256762	50002197	but I'll gladly pay $50 more to stay at Hilton, Hyatt or Marriott in the future.				
3256762	50002198	Wyndham never ever again!

3238658	50002270	Road warrior in Charlotte ---SEP---		80002287	Dear wanda h, Thank you for your review and for sharing your thoughts and concerns.	
3238658	50002271	This is a nice hotel with poor cleaning staff my first room the bathroom was not cleaned, hair in the drain, old soap stuck on the soap dish and stains on the bedsheets.		80002288	We appreciate all feedback we receive and use it to help develop the product and the service we offer.

3238658	50002275	Great management is not enough to bring me back.		80002292	We appreciate your feedback as this is our best resource for improving guest services.

3311484	50002291	where again the staff were pleasant and welcoming.				
3311484	50002292	The food offered everything from buffet style to hot cooked breakfast.				
3311484	50002293	Deliciious.				
3311484	50002294	Because The Spa was out of order we were taken to a sister Hotel... minutes away... by taxi and did not miss out on this relaxing and luxurious facility.				
3311484	50002295	We had a fantastic birthday weekend .....as a treat for my husbands 70th birthday ......and it was the ideal setting in a great locality for us to experience London and all it has to offer.				
3311484	50002296	A special mention of Michael who, on the last day, helped me, very efficiently and without fuss, when I needed some medical attention.				
3311484	50002297	I was very impressed and thankful for his mature attitude.				
3311484	50002298	We will certainly recommend this well run Hotel with its excellent staff and we will return.				
3311484	50002299	Thankyou Roysl Montcalm London Hotel.

3250781	50002321	Waiting on front desk for check in or inquiries was usually a wait and not always pleasant.		80002353	I am so happy to hear you enjoyed our newly transformed hotel across from Waikiki Beach, and the entertainment at Swell infinity pool deck and Bar.	
3250781	50002322	Food from hotel was mediocre.		80002354	I am sorry to hear of your disappointment with waiting times.

3162698	50002330	Severe sting in the tail ---SEP--- Stayed here for one night with family.		80002369	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay.	
3162698	50002331	Booked three rooms.		80002370	I would like to thank you for your loyalty within the Intercontinental Hotel Group, I am so pleased to hear that you've been a Priority Club member for such a long time.	
3162698	50002332	Priority Pass member of twenty years.		80002371	I am so glad to hear that you found the hotel to be clean, quiet and comfortable.	
3162698	50002333	Hotel is ok and of a standard you would expect for a Holiday Inn property.		80002372	Our housekeeping team do work extremely hard to maintain a high level of cleanliness and comfort throughout the hotel for our guests.	
3162698	50002334	Clean.		80002373	As we are a Holiday Inn Express hotel, we are not full service, as you mentioned, so are only able to provide the free, hot option breakfast.	
3162698	50002335	Quiet.		80002374	However, we do provide pizzas in the evenings for our guests, which can be ordered at the bar for guests to sit in the dinning room and eat, or take back up to their room if they wish.	
3162698	50002336	Comfortable.		80002375	I am so sorry to hear that you received a parking fine while staying with us, I do apologise for this.	
3162698	50002337	Unfortunately this hotel (really a motel, as it doesn't provide full hotel services e.g. no meals other than breakfast, no fridge in the room etc.) is a poor advertisement for the Holiday Inn brand, very much let down by poor staff attention to detail.		80002376	As guests enter the car park, there is a company called ParkingEye who will take a picture of the vehicle registration plate, and if this isn't registered in the terminals at reception, it will issue an automatic fine when the vehicle exits the car park.	
3162698	50002338	To explain: Upon arrival early evening, we checked into the motel having pre-paid via a third party internet booking agency.		80002377	I am sorry that the member of staff checking yourself in didn't make you aware that you needed to register your vehicle in the terminal, I am extremely disappointed to hear this happened and will be discussing this with the team.	
3162698	50002339	The promise was good - free broadband, free breakfast etc. etc.		80002378	Our car park is for guests only, which is why we have the ParkingEye system in place, there are signs throughout the car park informing people entering the car park, that their vehicle registration number needs to be registered.	
3162698	50002340	During the check-in procedure we were asked if we has a vehicle in the car park.		80002379	We do try to take the car parking charge of ¬£8 a night upon check in, although some guests choose to pay on check out for this.	
3162698	50002341	"We did, and we provided the staff with the registration number and felt comfortable that the hotel was aware of our (rental) vehicle, given that the car park is for exclusive use of guests we were ""in the system""."		80002380	Guests pay at reception for this, as the parking charge is added to the bill.	
3162698	50002342	Good.		80002381	There was obviously some confusion with your parking charge not being applied to your bill, and the vehicle not being registered, so I sincerely apologise that this happened.	
3162698	50002343	All went well.		80002382	As you have already paid for this parking fine through the rental company, if you contact the hotel, either by email; info@expressbath.co.uk, or telephone; 01225 303000, with the parking reference number, and your vehicle registration number that appears on the ParkingEye fine, we are more than happy to contact ParkingEye and get this fine refunded and cancelled for yourself, as well as contacting the car rental company for you.	
3162698	50002344	The next day we prepared for check-out.		80002383	I would like to apologise again, for this confusion and inconvenience, and thank you for taking the time to write a review, it is feedback such as yours which enables us to see how we are doing, and what areas we can improve on in the future.	
3162698	50002345	I was busy packing numerous suitcases into our vehicle and my wife attended to the check-out formalities.		80002384	Kind Regards, Lauren Jones	
3162698	50002346	She was advised by the hotel staff that everything was in order in relation to our account				
3162698	50002347	"and she was advised we were ""good to go"" or something to that effect."				
3162698	50002348	What a surprise a couple of weeks later when I checked my credit card account to find a GBP102.00 charge from the rental car company.				
3162698	50002349	"Turns out the vehicle had been ""ticketed"" with a fine of GBP60 (plus rental car company GBP42 service charge to process the fine) for unpaid parking charges at Holiday Inn Bath."				
3162698	50002350	Incredible!				
3162698	50002351	I have researched and found that (a) there are signs that advise of the overnight parking charge, however the details are listed below the warning that the car park is for guests only.				
3162698	50002352	The impression is that an overnight charge applies to deter local non-guest cars from parking there, but no worry we had registered our car at reception (b) how do guests pay the charge?				
3162698	50002353	Do the staff collect at reception, and if so why wasn't this issue raised with us during the check-in procedure?				
3162698	50002354	(c) if there's some other way to pay the fee, surely the very least the staff could do is remind guests to pay the fee, especially as we had provided details that we had a car in the car park.				
3162698	50002355	Such a small service would cost the motel nothing and be well appreciated by guests!				
3162698	50002356	There is clearly a lack of customer service ethic.				
3162698	50002357	To add insult to injury, after reading other Trip Advisor comments, it appears there is discretion to waive the overnight car park fee.				
3162698	50002358	I wonder how one qualifies for a waiver?				
3162698	50002359	"Further, only the ""free this"" and ""free that"" are advertised on the booking web site, no mention that this is one of the only motels I've stayed at globally that charges guests for parking (with perhaps the exception of big city centre hotels)."				
3162698	50002360	On reflection, I'm not sure how we fell through the cracks and earned such an expense, but it leaves a baste taste and I will not stay at this property in future and will not recommend others to do so.				
3162698	50002361	No doubt the motel will have a glossy explanation - it won't help me.				
3162698	50002362	I suggest the management try a spot of staff training on the ways they can make their guests have a more pleasant stay without any stings in the tail.				
3162698	50002363	After all, they have a global brand to protect.				
3162698	50002364	One more point: The motel has a small area stocked with drinks, snacks, pre-cooked meals etc.				
3162698	50002365	If you don't want to pay the motel's inflated prices, walk across the road to the petrol station (one minute) where you can get the same products in the convenience store for around a quarter of the price.				
3162698	50002366	Why don't hotels/motels get the message and just charge reasonable prices for their incidental products - they'd sell a lot more product and generate more revenue based on quantity of sales?				
3162698	50002367	I have only ever found one hotel (in Asia) that charged 7/11 prices in their mini-bar - their revenue increased 10-fold!				

3292056	50002370	Beautiful comfort ---SEP---		80002395	Thanks Daz for your lovely review.	
3292056	50002371	We booked the whole place out with my family.		80002396	It was a pleasure having you stay - your grandparents were a particular treat.	
3292056	50002372	Beautiful rooms.		80002397	We look forward to welcoming you back another time.	
3292056	50002373	All large and well set out.				
3292056	50002374	A great location.				
3292056	50002375	Breakfast was delicious.				
3292056	50002376	Unfortunately we could only stay one night.				
3292056	50002377	We will definitely stay here again.				

3200412	50002380	overpriced ---SEP---		80002408	Hello Kip D, Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent stay at Le Meridien Indianapolis.	
3200412	50002381	We stayed for one night only.		80002409	I apologize for your experience, or lack thereof, at the bar.	
3200412	50002382	Room was incredibly small, just big enough for the king size bed and a nice TV at the foot of the bed.		80002410	Although our staff would have given last call prior to closing the bar for business, we could have offered to grab you a quick beer or a glass of wine.	
3200412	50002383	Bathroom was the best, especially the shower.		80002411	We feel strongly that in a competitive review of the market, our rooms are well worth the rates that we are charging.	
3200412	50002384	Short distance to the Bankers Fieldhouse.		80002412	Over $100,000 per guestroom was spent during our renovation only two months ago.	
3200412	50002385	After the game, we stopped for some food and decided to have a cocktail at the hotel lounge.		80002413	Those rates are of course commensurate with the occupancy demands of the city and can sometimes get high due to demand, especially considering we are so conveniently located in the heart of downtown as you mentioned.	
3200412	50002386	With 14 other patrons bellied up to the bar with drinks, we did not get served, sorry we're closed.		80002414	Again, thank you for your feedback.	
3200412	50002387	No breakfast offered, not even continental.		80002415	I will address your concerns with the service staff at the bar and ensure that future guest are offered a nightcap if it is shortly after last call is given.	
3200412	50002388	No coffee maker in the room, just an espresso machine so plan on going for a walk to have your morning coffee.		80002416	Sincerely, Nick Clark General Manager	
3200412	50002389	Everything about this hotel is small and tight, Even the elevator is a tight fit for 2 with luggage. overpriced.				

3186089	50002390	Clean and Comfortable ---SEP---		80002427	Dear Dave, I'm so pleased the DoubleTree by Hilton Denver is your hotel of choice in Denver!

3186089	50002392	Although a bit of drive to City centre, it was well located with shopping centre close by and a number if local eating locations..		80002429	No matter what brings you to our city, we're here to help and make your stay comfortable.	
3186089	50002393	Perfect nights rest before hitting the snow fields...		80002430	A sparkling clean room, delicious food, and friendly staff set us apart from others - and bring travelers like you back again and again.	
3186089				80002431	I look forward to your future visits!	
3186089				80002432	Please let me know if we can be of any service during your travels.	
3186089				80002433	Sincerely, Allen Paty, General Manager	

3294382	50002400	Holiday Paradise !		80002444	Wow Pete & Wends.	
3294382	50002401	---SEP---		80002445	that is high praise indeed .	
3294382	50002402	The location of the apartments is perfect for anyone who wants to combine walking with a beach location.		80002446	Thank you sooooo much.	
3294382	50002403	Within a few yards of leaving the apartment you descend into the Chine.		80002447	Thank you also for your continued support over some 12(?) years now.	
3294382	50002404	A walk through a magical forest and within minutes you receive a beautiful view of golden clean sands, stretching for miles both ways, and lovely blue sea.		80002448	It has been so special to watch your beautiful granddaughter blossom each year into the special young lady she is now.

3294382	50002406	We have stayed at Fenn Lodge for many years as a Guest House (12 bedrooms) with Sandy and Bruce as our wonderful hosts with my granddaughter.		80002450	Meanwhile take care of each other and keep well.	
3294382	50002407	3 years ago Sandy and Bruce decided to change Fenn Lodge to 5 self catering apartments.		80002451	( Hope the flowers bloom prolifically)	
3294382	50002408	We were so disappointed but no need - we have now stayed in two of the apartments and they are the BEST.		80002452	Sandy	
3294382	50002409	Simply amazing apartments, so clean and spacious and tastefully furnished with views from balcony into the forest and garden below with a wonderful surprise at night !!!!!				
3294382	50002410	!				
3294382	50002411	Yes our hosts feed a family of badgers and foxes - delightful and wonderful to watch especially for children.				
3294382	50002412	The owners Sandy and Bruce are amazing - nothing too much trouble.				
3294382	50002413	Can't wait for our next visit.				

3195394	50002420	Comfy Place ---SEP---		80002463	Dear Aline; We write as the heat and rain make your January stay seem like a whole different season!

3195394	50002423	The room is amazing, fireplace, a huge bathroom and a romantic environment.		80002466	Chef Pandora loves feedback, yours was shared and he is appreciative of the mention.	
3195394	50002424	"The only ""problem"" is: There is nobody there to help you with questions before 3pm (We would like to try an early check-in)."		80002467	The entire team remains poised to welcome you back anytime you can escape the Boston market...	
3195394	50002425	But staff is amazing!		80002468	Yours in travel; Steve, Nancy, Katey and Chef Pandora

3195394	50002430	We certainly will be back to this hotel!				

3228799	50002440	Wonderful surprise ---SEP---		80002479	I am glad we were able to surprise you and that you enjoyed your stay in OKC and at the terrific Skirvin.	
3228799	50002441	Wow, what a pleasant surprise!		80002480	Thank you for recognizing several of our Team members and taking the time to review us.	
3228799	50002442	Drove cross-country from San Diego and found this entire hotel experience to be well above average.		80002481	Continued best wishes for safe travels cross-country	
3228799	50002443	Valet and Bell service members were personable and prompt.		80002482	and we hope to see you soon for a return visit.	
3228799	50002444	Desk service was good.		80002483	Martin van der Laan I General Manager	
3228799	50002445	The hotel is really beautiful and we enjoyed exploring it and getting great pictures.		80002484	I martinvanderlaan@skirvinhilton.com	
3228799	50002446	Rooms are nice and quiet.				
3228799	50002447	Overall I'd say that my wife and I would come back to OKC just to stay at the Skirvin!				

3170966	50002450	Average for a 5-star Hotel ---SEP---		80002495	Dear AR003, Thank you very much for your review.	
3170966	50002451	My family and I stayed here during the Victoria Day long weekend.		80002496	I'm sorry to see that you were not fully satisfied with your stay.	
3170966	50002452	Overall, the hotel was unimpressive considering the reputation of the Fairmont chain of hotels.		80002497	Indeed your negative experience with a member of our staff is truly unfortunate and I'm sorry to see that this has occurred.	
3170966	50002453	However, we did enjoy our stay since we had a beautiful view of the mountains and were only steps away from the village.		80002498	Our mission is to offer exceptional service for our guests and it is most concerning to see that this was not the case.	
3170966	50002454	The hotel offered a number of amenities that we availed of, the room was decently-sized, the beds were comfortable, but the air conditioner was very noisy.		80002499	I was relieved to see that your stay was enjoyable on other levels and that you enjoyed the mountain view from your room.	
3170966	50002455	In general, the staff were friendly, however on our first day there, one of the front-desk staff members (she had blonde hair and blue eyes - we should have gotten her name) was very curt when we asked for more information about the hotel/village.		80002500	We hope to welcome you again in the future.	
3170966	50002456	We were taken aback by her demeanor but otherwise, we found the other staff members to be more helpful.		80002501	Regards, Louise Champagne	

3230382	50002460	Fantastic hotel - Even better staff ---SEP---		80002512	Dear Kilcourse1234, Thank you so much for the wonderful review from your recent visit to the Stormont Hotel, I am delighted to read you found our staff professional and polite through all departments in particular Laura & Ryan in our Reception.	
3230382	50002461	I had travelled to Belfast on business for a conference and stayed two nights at the Stormont.		80002513	We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel in the near future.	
3230382	50002462	I arrived on the Thursday and was greeted by Laura on reception who, whilst dealing with a tour group of around 30 people made sure I was dealt with immediately aswell by calling for a colleague, I was happy to wait but what a fantastic first impression of this hotel and it‚Äôs staff.		80002514	Warmest Regards Scott Weatherup Deputy General Manager E: dgm@stor.hastingshotels.com	
3230382	50002463	The room was extremely clean and perfect for what I needed.				
3230382	50002464	I attented the conference on Friday and the the gala ball in the hotel in the evening, the staff were once again second to none, looking after us all night.				
3230382	50002465	The next morning I was again greeted by Laura and another member of staff, Ryan as I checked out.				
3230382	50002466	They enquired as to wether everything was ok with my stay, which it was and entered into friendly conversation.				
3230382	50002467	They, and all the staff were extremely professional and polite throughout and are a credit to the hotel.				
3230382	50002468	I need to return every couple of months for work going forward and wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else as a result.				
3230382	50002469	Thank you again for a great stay!

3253323	50002476	Friendly pool bar staff.				
3253323	50002477	And good in room snack selections--pale ale, Corona, water, soda, juices, chips, chex mix--perfect for late evening impromptu gathering.				

3283470	50002480	Excellent hotel, personable service ---SEP---		80002537	Dear 239RichardH, I am absolutely over the moon with you fantastic review!	
3283470	50002481	We stayed for one night and had a fantastic stay.		80002538	Although our location and amazing views over the Strand are one of our biggest highlights, I am proud that the Amba Hotel Charing Cross is known as one of the most friendly hotels in London, all due to excellent customer service delivered by my wonderful team!	
3283470	50002482	The moment we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a member of the front of house team.		80002539	I truly hope we will have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future and please, feel free to contact me directly if you need any assistance.	
3283470	50002483	We checked in and within 10 minutes were in our room.		80002540	Wishing you a very happy Festive Season, Kindest Regards, Pedro da Silva General Manager pedro.dasilva@amba-hotel.com	
3283470	50002484	The front desk team are clearly well trained.				
3283470	50002485	The service was very warm, professional and genuine.				
3283470	50002486	Probably one of the best first impressions I have experienced during a check in process.				
3283470	50002487	When I arrived to my room, there was a greeting card hand written, personally welcoming me to the hotel.				
3283470	50002488	They had gone the extra mile by doing some research about me and mentioning the name of my company with the tailor made greeting card.				
3283470	50002489	Very impressive and a nice touch.				
3283470	50002490	Our room overlooked the impressive views on the Strand.				
3283470	50002491	Excellent facilities and a true great hospitality experience.				
3283470	50002492	I highly recommended this hotel if you are looking for a place that will look after you, with excellent facilities, a very comfortable rooom and a central London location.				

3306299	50002500	Great location ---SEP---		80002551	Dear Annette H Thank you for staying with us at Jury's Inn Cork and letting us know about your experience.	
3306299	50002501	Great location an easy 5 minute walk into the town centre.		80002552	I really like to hear you did enjoy your stay with us.	
3306299	50002502	Lovely comfortable rooms, and great clean bathroom.		80002553	Our team endeavor to ensure each guest receives the true Jury's Inn experience.	
3306299	50002503	Tea and coffee provided in room.		80002554	We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.	
3306299	50002504	No in-room safe.		80002555	Best Regards Jenny	
3306299	50002505	Limited parking on site, but over 2 nights always magaged to get on-site or on-street parking (disc required - available for 2 euros from reception).				
3306299	50002506	Would recommend.				

3249761	50002510	Should be retired ---SEP---		80002566	I am truly sorry to hear your experience was not what it should have been during your stay.	
3249761	50002511	Got there and had to hunt down the front desk staff, who was outside having a cigarette.		80002567	We always have on going renovations to try to keep our property at the finest levels.	
3249761	50002512	Our room overlooked an empty parts lot and there was barbed wire between the motel and the lot.		80002568	Next time you come to town be sure to give me a call and I will be sure to ensure your view is improved.	
3249761	50002513	Not a good feeling.				
3249761	50002514	This is a tired motell and should be allowed to go gracefully, not piece by piece until it becomes an embarrassment to the community.				

3236859	50002520	No ---SEP---		80002579	I am unable to validate whether this is a genuine review and trip advisor will only remove reviews if abusive or threatening language is used regardless of the content.	
3236859	50002521	Nice looking in reception but got worse as you went up.		80002580	The hotel has a five star rating for food hygiene, the highest hygiene score achievable and we have had no reports of food poisoning in the last 10 years.	
3236859	50002522	The rooms and hall smelt musty, the beer was flat but worst of all was sick all night after eating in their restaurant Never again.		80002581	We have not had any complaints with regards flat beer from the 800 guests who stay with us on a weekly basis either.	
3236859	50002523	For that price the least you expect is fresh smelling sheets and your meal to stay inside you for more than 3 hours		80002582	The hotel boast full occupancy on 2 to 3 days every week, meaning our rooms and corridors are unlikely to smell anything other than fresh and of course are linen is delivered daily and beds freshly made for all arriving guests.	
3236859				80002583	Although I have contacted yourself to validate your review I have sadly not received a reply and no guest upon check out has made us aware of any illness as surely would be the case.	
3236859				80002584	There are many viral infections than manifest as food poisoning symptoms and that effect both taste and smell which would possibly explain why you felt the beer was flat and that all areas were not fresh smelling.	
3236859				80002585	Although it is understandable that the last food source is blamed for any sickness it is also very unlikely.	
3236859				80002586	The Hotel serves over 200 meals daily and the fact only one person would be affected would suggest that this was a viral condition.	

3258948	50002530	Great place for all ---SEP--- great place well worth the money spent on it great service		80002597	Dear Ben S, Thank you for taking the time to write this fantastic review!	
3258948	50002531	i really enjoyed staying there the beds are very comfortable the spa was great loved every second of my stay while i was there and would recomend it to all ages honey moon style was great		80002598	Our spacious apartments which include kitchen and laundry are an affordable option for those wanting more than a hotel room for their trip to Sydney.	
3258948				80002599	Being ideally located in the city with restaurants and shopping close by makes Meriton Kent Street the logical choice!	
3258948				80002600	Thank you again and we look forward to welcoming you back soon!	
3258948				80002601	Kind Regards, Crystal M Senior Manager on Duty

3220263	50002552	They arranged for a free limo ride to and from Bricktown, and it was easy to use and access.		80002628	Please come back and see us again soon at the Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel.	
3220263	50002553	The Spa, was fabulous for our couples massage..and they gave us a later checkout because we were cleaning up after the spa visit helpful people everywhere, parking is a strange thing so if you go just get the valet parking so you won't be driving around and around for a place.

3274501	50002563	Will definitely return		80002642	We are thrilled to read that you will be returning and we look forward to welcoming you back.

3226744	50002572	Hotel staff, room and even the valet parking were cordial in every way.

3164034	50002610	City Oasis ---SEP--- little oasis in the middle of a busy city with beautiful gardens, a pool, BBQ, fantastic appartments facilitated by exceptional staff.		80002696	Thank you for your kind words regarding your recent stay at Quest Royal Gardens.	
3164034	50002611	Free Parking.		80002697	I am delighted to hear you enjoyed the tranquility of our gardens and were pleased with the service offered by our staff.

3315199	50002620	Great location, views, service ---SEP---		80002700	Good afternoon Mr. Baumgarti and thank you for sharing your experience.	
3315199	50002621	This property's location is perfect, 5 minute walk to Queenstown and about 10-15 minutes to the center.		80002701	I'm so pleased you enjoyed the serenity of our location, Sofitel Mybeds and our warm services.	
3315199	50002622	However, it is far enough away from the hussel and bussel.		80002702	Our Swiss-styled Architecture is most definitely akin to our namesake and I'm sorry your room allocation caused you inconvenience.	
3315199	50002623	The staff were friendly and helpful.		80002703	I have made a note to ensure we allocate a quieter room for future stays.	
3315199	50002624	The room was large and modern, bedding was very comfortable.		80002704	Please note all Accorhotels LeCLub members enjoy unlimited Wi-fi in all our hotels in New Zealand, and you also earn and use your points worldwide.	
3315199	50002625	We were on the 7th floor, which meant we had to take the elevator to the 6th and take the staircase up one more floor.		80002705	I do hope we have the opportunity in welcoming you back in the near future, and that you also have a chance to experience our award winning Lombardi restaurant.	
3315199	50002626	As our room was right above the front drive of the hotel, mornings got noisy when tour buses picked up.		80002706	With warm regards, Marina Silva Operations Manager	
3315199	50002627	We only used the hot tub garden at the property, which was fine.				
3315199	50002628	I can't speak to any of the eateries on property.

3315227	50002630	A Sweet Escape ---SEP--- Last weekend my husband and I threw a dinner party for some friends at The Standard Hotel.		80002717	Hi Sabina Thank you for taking the time to write this incredible review and for choosing The Standard, High Line for your staycation!	
3315227	50002631	We live in NYC, but decided to have a staycation at The Standard, as our friends were coming from out of town, and I had made arrangements for them to room there.		80002718	I am pleased to hear that from start to finish you experienced warm hospitality and sincere dedication to service.	
3315227	50002632	As I pulled up in my taxi from a long Saturday at the office, I instantly felt transported and ready for an exciting evening.		80002719	It's always so nice to know that even our local neighbors still find an exciting experience in visiting The Standard.	
3315227	50002633	The reception had a Swiss Chalet vibe- warm and inviting lounge area at the entrance- mix of well dressed travelers, and NY locals, drinks flowing, and a great atmosphere.		80002720	We look forward to welcoming you back soon, whether its for some more skating and hot chocolate, dinner at The Standard Grill, or another overnight stay!	
3315227	50002634	When I arrived to our room, my husband told me that he had taken our 11 yr old daughter skating at the Ice Rink in front of the hotel, and continued to tell me how nicely he had been treated by Paul Kashman, a Standard Exec., who had helped to arrange our weekend.				
3315227	50002635	Paul had our room prepared slightly earlier than expected as he saw our daughter had overexerted herself while skating, needing some R&R, and something warm to drink.				
3315227	50002636	A bowl of chicken soup arrived for our daughter instantly, and my husband was able to check in and enjoy the rest of the afternoon.				
3315227	50002637	When our friends arrived in the evening- we proceeded to a lovely dinner at The Standard Grill, and after party at Top of The Standard.				
3315227	50002638	The evening fantastically executed - no stone left unturned.				
3315227	50002639	The view and decor at Top of The Standard is truly spectacular, one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC.				
3315227	50002640	(A must see even for a New Yorker)				
3315227	50002641	The next morning, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise above the Hudson River- from our room's floor to ceiling windows, and amazingly comfortable bed.				
3315227	50002642	Great Party-				
3315227	50002643	Fun Staycation-				
3315227	50002644	Perfect Weekend!!				
3315227	50002645	I would definately book a weekend just like this one at The Standard again.				
3315227	50002646	Special thanks to Paul Kashman and Adam Fakier for their attention to detail and for such a memorable experience.				

3189456	50002650	My first but not my last visit ---SEP---		80002731	Dear Happercamper, Thank you for the terrific feedback from your recent visit to our Hotel.	
3189456	50002651	I thoroughly enjoyed my over-night stay at the Delta Armouries hotel in London.		80002732	We are delighted to hear you appreciate the restoration of the original Armouries building, and that you were able to enjoy the artifacts we've have on display.	
3189456	50002652	This property is a high rise modern hotel built inside the walls of an old Armoury in London.		80002733	We're also so pleased to hear all the staff provided you with exception service throughout your stay.	
3189456	50002653	I am from a military family, so this was very cool to me.		80002734	I will be sure to share your kind words with the entire Armouries team for thanks and recognition!	
3189456	50002654	My Dad spoke of this Armoury many times during his military career.		80002735	Once again, we are happy to have had you stay with us.	
3189456	50002655	I finally had the opportunity to stay at the hotel & experience the Armoury, well at least the original walls.		80002736	Please come back and visit us again soon!	
3189456	50002656	:)				
3189456	50002657	If you are interested in the military history of this property, there is even a mini museum on the 2nd floor.				
3189456	50002658	Very well done.				
3189456	50002659	I was extremely impressed with the excellent customer service at this hotel from customer check-in, the housekeeping staff, to check-out.				
3189456	50002660	I was made to feel special & welcome from the time I arrived to the time I left, even though my stay was very short.				
3189456	50002661	The level of professional, friendly service was exceptional.				
3189456	50002662	My room, recently renovated, was spacious & had everything I needed.				
3189456	50002663	I wish I knew the names of everyone who served me, because I would list all of them in this review.				
3189456	50002664	However, one name stands out from the rest.				
3189456	50002665	Marguerite, one of the housekeeping staff went over & above for me & provided a bath chair for the bathtub.				
3189456	50002666	I have some minor mobility issues, so she pleasantly suggested that she bring me this bath chair.				
3189456	50002667	I travel a lot for work & rarely experience this level of kindness & caring.				
3189456	50002668	There is a pool & a hot tub on the second floor.				
3189456	50002669	I mainly used the hot tub & thought it was a real treat on a cold, snowy winter Saturday in London.				
3189456	50002670	I had lunch & dinner at the Armouries Grille on the Saturday.				
3189456	50002671	The servers were extremely attentive to my food allergies.				
3189456	50002672	Very much appreciated.				
3189456	50002673	Both meals were excellent.				
3189456	50002674	I would highly recommend the plated roast beef which they serve on Saturday evenings.				
3189456	50002675	I will definitely return to the Delta Armouries Hotel in London--- for a longer visit next time.				
3189456	50002676	:)

3217426	50002696	Some of the decoration looked in need of a a touch up.				
3217426	50002697	Very grubby paintwork, skirtings, doors - needs a lick of paint all over.				
3217426	50002698	Wish we had paid extra for superior view room.

3172258	50002721	We arrived late in the evening and the 2 bedroom loft was no longer available.		80002781	We always appreciate feedback in regards to the hotel and the staff/service so thank you for taking the time!	
3172258	50002722	They put us in a 2 bedroom suite instead, which was even better.		80002782	We are very glad you enjoyed your trip to Phoenix and most importantly we are glad you enjoyed your stay with us!	
3172258	50002723	We were traveling with my elderly parents and it allowed us to stay close to them and still have privacy.		80002783	We really hope we see you again the next time you visit Phoenix, thank you again for your review!	
3172258	50002724	The room included a nice living room where we were able to visit with some family in the area.				
3172258	50002725	We ate breakfast outside on the patio area (very nice).				
3172258	50002726	At night we sat outside near the fire pit to visit with more family.				
3172258	50002727	It was very relaxing and a nice atmosphere.				
3172258	50002728	The room was decorated beautifully.				
3172258	50002729	It felt more like a condo.

3181763	50002735	Our other friends stayed in the classic rooms and whilst small found them well appointed and comfortable.				
3181763	50002736	On a previous visit to Dublin (October 2005)				
3181763	50002737	I came to the Westbury and dined in The Russell Room.				
3181763	50002738	The cuisine was wonderful and the staff were very attentive.				
3181763	50002739	I was well looked after on both occasions and made to feel very welcome.				
3181763	50002740	This hotel is in a great location for the sights, sounds & nightlife of Dublin.				
3181763	50002741	A great hotel in a greater city.

3315929	50002770	CONTINUES TO BE A BARGAIN ---SEP---		80002837	We are so glad to hear from you and to learn that we were able to give you a pleasant experience.	
3315929	50002771	We frequently stay at the Econo Lodge by Sky Harbor Airport not only when we are traveling out of state but when we want to stay overnight in Phoenix for events, etc.		80002838	It's rewarding to learn that we exceeded your expectations with the accommodations, hospitality and cleanliness of our guest rooms.	
3315929	50002772	We stayed on Sunday night after the Cardinals game rather than driving back to Sedona in the dark.		80002839	We hope you're looking forward to your next stay as much as we are!	
3315929	50002773	We were pleasantly surprised to find Econo Lodge has added small refrigerators and microwaves to their rooms.				
3315929	50002774	The rooms have always been a bargain, clean, safe and quiet and now are even more convenient.				
3315929	50002775	The surrounding area isn't the best but there are some great small ethnic restaurants nearby.				

3317039	50002780	Good food ---SEP---		80002840	Dear Geoffrey, thank you for your overall positive review.	
3317039	50002781	Only complaint about room is that floorboards squeak.		80002841	I am really pleased that you enjoyed our food and service and we hope to see you again sometime Patricia Green	
3317039	50002782	Otherwise excellent.				
3317039	50002783	It is a good idea to get a dinner bed and breakfast deal.				
3317039	50002784	You can choose from the a la carte menu - though some of the more expensive items do carry a moderate supplement.				

3308208	50002790	Good place in Golden ---SEP---		80002852	Thank you for posting your comments.	
3308208	50002791	Nice hotel in Golden just off the highway.		80002853	I‚Äôm delighted to hear you had a pleasant stay and enjoyed the spacious, comfortable rooms.	
3308208	50002792	It has a very nice mountain view.		80002854	We hope to see you back in Golden again soon!	
3308208	50002793	Very quiet.		80002855	Candace West Marketing Coordinator	
3308208	50002794	Did not hear highway traffic or trains.				
3308208	50002795	Room was very large and clean.				
3308208	50002796	Easy to get around town from there as well.				

3314480	50002800	Best range of Accommodation in Te Anau ---SEP--- Lakeview holiday park is where we always stay in Te Anau.		80002866	We are delighted that you choose to stay with us on your trips to Te Anau and you enjoy the Marakura Units.	
3314480	50002801	This time three of us on a tramping trip stayed two separate nights in the very upmarket Marakura Lodge.		80002867	We look forward to hosting you again in the future.	
3314480	50002802	The comfort and fit out of this is excellent, the kitchen very well equipped and the stunning views across the Lake are unimpeded				

3161823	50002810	Very happy with our stay.		80002878	Dear Kevin N, I was glad to read you experienced an enjoyable stay at Park Hyatt Melbourne last month, and the team assisted in meeting your expectations.	
3161823	50002811	---SEP---		80002879	We thank you for your feedback and look forward to welcoming you back to Park Hyatt Melbourne.	
3161823	50002812	From check in to check out, everything was easy and enjoyable, thankyou.		80002880	Regards Brett Sweetman ‚Äì Hotel Manager	
3161823	50002813	Room service was fast, and food was hot and delicious.				
3161823	50002814	Light, airy and clean rooms with a wonderful view.				
3161823	50002815	Will definately stay there again.				

3324640	50002820	Really friendly staff and nice hotel ---SEP---		80002891	Thank you very much for your kind review.	
3324640	50002821	My husband, my 2 year old and I stayed over the bank holiday weekend and we loved it!		80002892	We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your first visit to the island and that you decided to stay with us.	
3324640	50002822	It was our first time to IOW so decided to stay with a known brand for comfort etc.		80002893	We are glad that you found our staff friendly and helpful, we pride ourselves on the service that we give and it is always nice to hear when this is appreciated so thank you from all of us.	
3324640	50002823	Hotel was nice, rooms nicely decorated and clean, and massive bed (so good fir the three of us)!		80002894	We too love our location and count ourselves very lucky.	
3324640	50002824	The staff were really friendly and helpful in : giving directions to room, offering to help with luggage, friendly towards our son and offering to store his goats milk etc...simple stuff..but many hotels in the past have not shown the same hospitality so it really stood out here..we travel yearly abroad and uk, but this is the first time I've wanted to write a review because of the exceptional service !		80002895	We hope to see you again on your next island trip.	
3324640	50002825	Definitely recommend.		80002896	Kind Regards Team Holmwood	
3324640	50002826	Location is great, literally on the beach and 10 min walk to town and restaurants.				

3182615	50002830	Fantastic hotel with amazing food.		80002907	Dear Gary M, On behalf of everybody here at Clontarf Castle, I would like thank you for your very kind comments regarding your experience at Clontarf Castle.	
3182615	50002831	---SEP---		80002908	Thank you for your wonderful comments about the team, they will be ecstatic to hear that you found them to be extremely courteous and that they went out of their way to accommodate everyone.	
3182615	50002832	My partner and I attended a dinner event in one of the Suites in Clontarf Castle recently and I cannot recommend the hotel enough.		80002909	I will of course relay your kind words onto Eileen and let her know that she looked after you all exceedingly well.	
3182615	50002833	The staff were extremely courteous and went out of their way to ensure that our group had everything we needed.		80002910	It is wonderful to hear that your meal was delicious and that everything was cooked to perfection.	
3182615	50002834	I would like to especially thank Eileen who looked after us exceedingly well in the Norman Suite.		80002911	Thank you again for your review and I hope it is not too long before we have the privilege and the pleasure of welcoming you back again.	
3182615	50002835	The food was delicious,everything was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful.		80002912	Jason Ormston General Manager	
3182615	50002836	While we didn't stay over in the hotel itself (this time)				
3182615	50002837	I would have no hesitation in coming back again and again.				
3182615	50002838	A fantastic hotel with amazing staff.				

3195133	50002840	Nice Hotel ---SEP---		80002923	Thank you for your kind words.	
3195133	50002841	"Great boutique hotel with a ""chill"" bar and cafe."		80002924	I'm glad you enjoyed our cozy little lobby bar as well as our friendly staff.	
3195133	50002842	It is close to everything, the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean and spacious and the beds are comfortable.		80002925	We appreciate your business and look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3195133	50002843	We would happily come back again.		80002926	Aloha	

3214794	50002850	Lovely stay Glasgow ---SEP---		80002937	Dear Guest, Thank you for your excellent review, I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and thank you for your kind comments about our hotel, we can't wait to welcome you back!	
3214794	50002851	Had an amazing stay at the jurys inn!		80002938	The next time you are visiting Glasgow please feel free to contact me direct - hazel_galloway@jurysinns.com Kind Regards, Hazel Galloway	
3214794	50002852	Perfect location down by the river Clyde :)				
3214794	50002853	had some problems with the room keys not working in the afternoon, had to walk all the way back down to reset the keys, other than that it was super :)				

3182957	50002860	Perfect hosts; great location for our school trip!		80002949	Guys what can we say, thanks so much for this review, it's always amazing to have such happy customers & get feedback.	
3182957	50002861	---SEP---		80002950	Your school group were amazing, top notch all round.	
3182957	50002862	I have just returned after an 8 day visit with 2 lots of 50 14 year old students and 10 teachers.		80002951	See you next year!	
3182957	50002863	Craig and his family could not have done any more for us to make our stay any better.		80002952	Craig :0)	
3182957	50002864	The location is perfect: close to centre of town but far enough from the noise, very near Fistral and the harbour.				
3182957	50002865	The accommodation is perfect for a school group, the rooms, layout, atmosphere, decor, lounge and dining space suiting our needs totally.				
3182957	50002866	The home cooked food is lovely, especially the 'packed lunches' and as it's home cooked was able to accommodate the various allergies and food intolerances our group contained.				
3182957	50002867	The service is brilliant - Craig was practically another member of our school team, helping us out, being our local tour guide, couldn‚Äôt do any more to make us feel at home and had a great manner with the students (and great fun with staff.)				
3182957	50002868	The Ocean Lodge is a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone.				
3182957	50002869	But for any schools looking for a base for their school trip to Newquay you could not find a better stay than here.				
3182957	50002870	Our water sports holiday has run with Elemental UK (http://www.elementaluk.com/) in Newquay for over 12 years and we have stayed in many different hotels in Newquay but we are booked up here next year already!				
3182957	50002871	Thank you again to our hosts Craig, Carol and family.				
3182957	50002872	We are looking forward already to doing the same again next year and this being our permanent base for our school trip.				

3234090	50002880	Pay more for a better place.		80002963	Dear DPF1976, Thank you for your comments and honest feedback.	
3234090	50002881	---SEP---		80002964	We are happy that the staff was helpful and that you enjoyed the location of our hotel.	
3234090	50002882	So, I'm not sure where to begin.		80002965	We apologize for the inconveniences that you experienced and have forwarded your comments to management.	
3234090	50002883	The lobby looks nice & the staff are friendly & the location is decent, but that's it.		80002966	If you were unable to have these issues addressed during your stay, please email us directly at sales2@ramadaplazawaikiki.com.	
3234090	50002884	The place smells from the lobby to the room.		80002967	Warmest aloha, Pattie Furtado	
3234090	50002885	Chairs in room are worn.				
3234090	50002886	Stains on the blackout curtains.				
3234090	50002887	Fridge smells very bad.				
3234090	50002888	Hair was left in the shower from previous guests & sat there on the wall ALL week till we left.				
3234090	50002889	A/C doesn't work all that well, even for a late trip in January.				
3234090	50002890	The WiFi was garbage.				
3234090	50002891	Beds were semi comfortable but the pillows were not.				
3234090	50002892	My advice is for people to pay more for a better place that doesn't smell & that has the maid service that will actually be attentive enough to properly clean a room.				

3233089	50002900	Poor Security and NO help from Hotel after Car Vandalism and Theft ---SEP---		80002978	I'm extremely sorry for the incident that occurred during your stay w/ us.	
3233089	50002901	The hotel, staff and food were fine, but very minimal security in the parking lot and no cameras.		80002979	Please be assured that there is regularly scheduled security officers who patrol the parking lots throughout all the nighttime hours.	
3233089	50002902	Our car was vandalized and items stolen.		80002980	Again, I apologize for the inconvenience and poor experience.	
3233089	50002903	People we spoke to said it happens fairly often (take your chances??).				
3233089	50002904	The parking lot is fairly isolated and they should provide adequate security.				
3233089	50002905	The hotel manager was very unfriendly and did nothing except say it is our problem.				
3233089	50002906	We lost about $400 in merchandise and $350 in car window repairs.				
3233089	50002907	The car was parked in view of the lobby.				
3233089	50002908	Will not stay there again.				

3246856	50002910	Very Nice Hotel ---SEP---		80002991	Dear MaryBethJ_65, Thank you for providing a thorough and kind review of your recent stay.	
3246856	50002911	Our flight was cancelled late at night due to weather and we chose the Hyatt Place near Charlotte airport.		80002992	I wish it was due to more pleasant circumstances, and understand flight cancellations can be stressful!	
3246856	50002912	The price at Hyatt Place was very fair, which was a relief since the airline was not paying for it.		80002993	Our staff do pride themselves on turning around the day of a distressed passenger and I am so happy to hear that they were able to relieve some of your stress from the day.	
3246856	50002913	The staff was warm and very welcoming.		80002994	Our 24/7 menu is a great option for weary travelers and the airport shuttle a great convenience.	
3246856	50002914	They offered late night food, which we also appreciated since we sat on a plane for a couple of hours without food.		80002995	Again, thank you for staying with us and I do hope we see you again soon!	
3246856	50002915	Everyone we came in contact with, including the airport shuttle drive the next morning, was fantastic!				

3188723	50002920	Could have been better ---SEP---		80003006	Hi Amy B, Thanks so much for your feedback and I'm so sorry about the few areas we fell short in.	
3188723	50002921	I only stayed one night		80003007	I will let you know that all of our showers are being remodeled so there will be no more issues with cracks or possibility of damage any further.	
3188723	50002922	but I felt there was some amount of service information missing.		80003008	We would love to have you come back again for another opportunity to serve you.	
3188723	50002923	I would expect that room service information would be provided at check-in, even if it's just basic hours of service.		80003009	Until then, Stay Happy!	
3188723	50002924	Also, their signature cookie wasn't available at check-in, as advertised.				
3188723	50002925	The elevatators are incredibly small, too.				
3188723	50002926	Much too small for the crowd at check-out time.				
3188723	50002927	We had to wait for ten minutes for two elevators to go arrive and each was too full for us to ride.				
3188723	50002928	I think the biggest problem I had, though, was that there was a crack in the floor of the shower in my room that, though it had been sealed, worried me a little.				
3188723	50002929	I have a hard time taking a relaxing shower if I'm afraid of damaging the floor.				
3188723	50002930	The staff I did interact with were polite and helpful and the themes were fun but, overall, it was kind of stressful.				

3283037	50002940	Really friendly and helpful staff ---SEP--- Very convenient, last minute stay.		80003010	Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.	
3283037	50002941	Good restaurant options opposite, with a Sainsbury's local just next door.		80003011	We want all our guests to feel right at home when staying with us so we are absolutely thrilled that our Team Members were able to make your stay even more enjoyable.	
3283037	50002942	Bit tricky to find from the station.		80003012	Our Hotel Managers regularly review their TripAdvisor reviews so that they can continue to offer pleasant and comfortable stays to our guests and take on any feedback.	
3283037	50002943	The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, genuinely chatty, good with children.		80003013	Thank you again for letting us know about your stay.	

3264367	50002950	Great park ---SEP--- Caloundra Big4 have gone above and beyond for our inconveniences staying here.		80003024	Hi Gayzla Glad to hear you and the family are enjoying your stay and there are so many good restaurants to choose from walking distance from the park.	
3264367	50002951	We have been moved from our original site, put on a site for one night then moved for the other 13 nights.		80003025	Cheers Rob & Team	
3264367	50002952	There are some other renovations and works being done around the grounds too, but we don‚Äôt feel inconvenienced at all.				
3264367	50002953	They have made our stay as comfortable as they can.				
3264367	50002954	This park set up is brilliant and we would definitely come back.				
3264367	50002955	The kids are having a ball in the pool, jumping pillow and playground.				
3264367	50002956	We have had a lovely walk to Kings Beach along the boardwalk and a shopping mall is just across the road.				
3264367	50002957	We had some fantastic Chinese last night at Chinese Holiday Resturant, on Bulcock St, only 7mins walk away.				
3264367	50002958	There are plenty of eateries around.				
3264367	50002959	The location is great!				
3264367	50002960	Only downfall would be the muddy grassed sites.				
3264367	50002961	The slabs are brilliant but the grass needs better drainage.				
3264367	50002962	I believe this is what they are working on at the moment?				

3239857	50002970	Don't Stay Here!		80003036	I am very sorry you did not have a pleasant stay at The Woods.	
3239857	50002971	---SEP---		80003037	I do not know why you did not have coffee in your room.	
3239857	50002972	This is definitely not a 3 star hotel.		80003038	Coffee is provided in every room.	
3239857	50002973	More like an old 1 star motel.		80003039	Since I do not have any of the unit information on your review, I would appreciate very much if you could contact me at the Resort and give me that information so that we can follow up & determine what happened so it can be corrected.	
3239857	50002974	You park in front of your motel room door : ( The room smelled musty, and bedding was outdated with yellowed sheets.		80003040	Please call the resort number at (417) 334-2324 and ask for the General Manager's Office.	
3239857	50002975	They advertise that they have free WiFi, but that us only for people who own a timeshare, otherwise it us $9.95 a day.		80003041	We would definitely love to hear from you so we can make sure we correct any issues going forward.	
3239857	50002976	They have a coffee pot, but no coffee.		80003042	Thank you, Dave	
3239857	50002977	Guess you have to be a timeshare owner to get the coffee.				
3239857	50002978	I'm only here for one night to attend a funeral, or I would would move to one of the other hotels that I have previously stayed at.				
3239857	50002979	Live and learn, won't stay here again.				

3178112	50002980	2 days of peace and quiet ---SEP--- staff were excellent the facility was very clean and had a well laid out breakfast.		80003053	Dear Alan, Thank you very much for taking your time to express your appreciation towards our staff and service provided as well as property and facilities that you had experienced during your stay.	
3178112	50002981	was very nice and enjoyable stay		80003054	These comments truly helps all of us team stay motivated.	
3178112				80003055	Please come again if you are in the area.	

3201872	50002990	Tired!		80003066	Thank you for this no nonsense review.	
3201872	50002991	---SEP---		80003067	While the common parts are scheduled for works in the fullness of time, for now we are concentrating our efforts on the bedrooms We were sorry to learn of this issues you encountered with Housekeeping and appreciate your feedback regarding the breakfast menu	
3201872	50002992	Reasonably priced and with good parking.		80003068	In all this we are heartened that you would stay again so thank you for this affirmation	
3201872	50002993	Therefore, I shall probably stay again.				
3201872	50002994	However, the rooms and corridors are sadly in need of redecoration.				
3201872	50002995	Room was not cleaned properly - curtains not drawn back, water glass not emptied.				
3201872	50002996	No breakfast menu provided.				

3196990	50003000	last minute choice ---SEP--- comfortable rooms and friendly service .		80003079	Dear Inspire31654876411, Thank you for your review on our hotel.

3196990	50003004	Staff warm and friendly				

3280819	50003010	7night stay - cost more then its worth... ---SEP---		80003091	Hi there Kitty, thank you for choosing to stay with us at Habitat HQ.	
3280819	50003011	Paid $280 for a week which i think is extortion, hostel isn't in a great location epically if you are walking back alone late at night I didn't feel safe I was also met by several prostitutes this was day and night.		80003092	We appreciate your feedback regarding the friendliness of the Staff, we are loving the Summer season!!!!!!!!!!	
3280819	50003012	Staff are helpful although at check in I was not given info on local shops/ tram stops which would of been greatly appreciated.		80003093	I am also glad that you have noticed the improved cleanliness of the bathrooms; we have been making a concentrated effort in these areas.	
3280819	50003013	As every person has said the beds are extremely creaky and this needs to be dealt with!!!		80003094	As in most hostels/homes the Kitchen is the heart of communal area.	
3280819	50003014	Rooms tiny had nowhere to put my luggage which was annoying had no plug near my bed or a side light, not the worst place I have stayed yet not the best!		80003095	We offer fantastic Kitchen facilities (3 microwaves, 2 ovens, 16 gas elements, 6 large fridges, 2 Toasted sandwich makers) I am sorry if you found it crowded during peak periods.	
3280819	50003015	Showers and bathrooms clean didn't use the kitchen once as it was always rammed and looked cramped!		80003096	At Habitat we pride our selves on offering our guests more than just a bed.	
3280819	50003016	Free wifi is gd!		80003097	For the cost of your stay you do also get free breakfast (bonus Pancakes on Wednesday), free Wifi, free parking, free walking tours, free dinner on Thursday, free airport shuttle (if staying more than 3 nights), clean linen and 24 hour access to the premises.	
3280819				80003098	St Kilda is renowned for being a diverse area; I am sorry you didn‚Äôt feel safe walking back at night.	
3280819				80003099	We do pride ourselves on our levels of security at the Hostel and do encourage guests to stick to well lit areas or taking a taxi home ($7 from Acland/Fitzroy st) if travelling solo after dark.	
3280819				80003100	I live locally and regularly have to cross St Kilda late at night.	
3280819				80003101	Personally I have never had a problem, I know from my own travels to just be aware of my surroundings.	
3280819				80003102	I am sorry if you were put out by not having a power point directly next to your bed.	
3280819				80003103	Every room does have multiple power points in them though for people who need to recharge their electrical goods.	
3280819				80003104	We sell at reception travel reading lights for $5; a great take home souvenir.	
3280819				80003105	Our rooms are considered to be fairly spacious, however if you are sharing with 9 other people who are travelling with large suitcases, day packs, surfboards, laptop bags etc the space can quickly fill up.	
3280819				80003106	We do provide storage draws under every bed and also provide cheap lockers for guest with excess luggage.	
3280819				80003107	Thank you again for choosing to stay with us and we hope you enjoy the rest of your travels.	
3280819				80003108	Katie and the Habitat HQ crew	

3306966	50003020	First trip to Charleston, best experience ---SEP---		80003119	"Dear ""azzigp"", Greetings from Charleston, SC!"	
3306966	50003021	Hotel was perfectly situated in downtown historic district with everything nearby, or a short walk away, or a short bike ride.		80003120	It was wonderful to have you stay with us at French Quarter Inn for your inaugural trip to Charleston!	
3306966	50003022	Friendly staff that even greeted me with a smile and champagne at midnight Taylor was there the second I arrived at midnight to pull the car into valet Kenyatta went above and beyond to make sure I got reservations at perfect time in one of the best restaurants in the city Anise was there at all times, keeping the conversation going, giving me tips on what to check out that tourists might overlook, and always walked around with a smile		80003121	Your notes about Kenyatta, Anice, and Taylor are really appreciated - we could not be successful if it wasn't for their hard work as well as the dedication from the rest of our team.	
3306966				80003122	I look forward to sharing your compliments with them as I know it will continue to motivate them to continue to provide personal service to our guests.	
3306966				80003123	Please come back to visit again and thank you for choosing us at French Quarter Inn!	
3306966				80003124	Sincere regards, Carlo Carroccia Hotel Manager	

3251353	50003030	Good value ---SEP---		80003135	Hi, Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3251353	50003031	The Days Inn is handy for the airport and cruise port.		80003136	We really appreciate your kind words, and glad to hear you find our hotel as a good value.	
3251353	50003032	The shuttle arrived at the airport within 15 mins after I phoned the hotel.		80003137	We strive hard to make every guest comfortable and happy, please stay with us next time you visit Fort Lauderdale.	
3251353	50003033	I booked the shuttle for the port and it left on time.		80003138	Next time we'll do our best to get a 5 star rating from your side.	
3251353	50003034	The cost was $10.		80003139	Please reach out to us next time you want to make reservation.	
3251353	50003035	The hotel is older and hard to keep pristine, but the room was clean and the bed comfortable.		80003140	Thanks and Regards, Management Team Days Inn - Fort Lauderdale	
3251353	50003036	The breakfast was adequate.				
3251353	50003037	Overall good value.				
3251353	50003038	This hotel did not deserve the bad reviews.				

3190779	50003040	1 night stay ---SEP---		80003151	Dear catkin2016 , Thank you for taking the time and trouble to submit a review following your stay at the Macdonald Bath Spa Hotel, I am really pleased that you had a great one night stay at the Hotel and had enjoyed the Spa and your evening meal, however please accept my apologies for your disappointment with your cooked breakfast, I will ensure that our Head Chef discusses this with the team to ensure that standards are upheld and maintained.	
3190779	50003041	Had a great stay here.		80003152	Thank you for recommending the Hotel and I look forward to welcoming you back again soon , Best wishes and kind regards, Mohamed	
3190779	50003042	Good position to walk into Bath then after a busy day the spa was a welcome treat.				
3190779	50003043	The evening meal was delicious and all staff were very friendly and helpful.				
3190779	50003044	We stayed in one of the ground floor rooms.				
3190779	50003045	It was comfortable but a not to a 5* standard, the mattress needed replacing and the room in general was a bit tired but for 1 night this was fine.				
3190779	50003046	The cold selection for breakfast was lovely with plenty of fresh fruit, cereals, croissants and yogurt to choose from however we were very disappointed with the cooked breakfast which was luke warm, with some items over cooked and wasn't particularly nice!				
3190779	50003047	Overall though I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing break.				

3197309	50003050	Great Location ---SEP---		80003163	Dear CozCouple, Warmest greetings from The Fitzwilliam Dublin!	
3197309	50003051	We will definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Dublin as we had a wonderful stay..		80003164	It was a pleasure to read your great review following your recent stay and we look forward to giving you another warm welcome and fantastic experience next time!	
3197309	50003052	The location is great and it is walking distance to a lot of sites, restaurants, shopping, and bars.		80003165	With kind regards, Grant Sarkisyan Guest Relations Manager	
3197309	50003053	The staff was always friendly and accommodating.				
3197309	50003054	One of the biggest selling points for us was the breakfast as it was very tasty and included in the room price.				
3197309	50003055	It would have been nice to have a bigger room, but we booked the basic room so it was not a big deal for us.				
3197309	50003056	The room was comfortable and everything worked properly.				

3294628	50003060	Funky place ---SEP---		80003176	Magjek, Thank you for the 4 stars review and I'm glad to hear that you had a great stay and enjoyed the restaurant.	
3294628	50003061	Interesting place to stay.		80003177	There's no denying that our building has some age to it, as part of Phoenix's history happened here at our hotel.	
3294628	50003062	Like a 60‚Äôs throwback.		80003178	But we are happy to hear that you like what we've done to the place.	
3294628	50003063	This is not a luxury spa, but the updates to the old building are creative.		80003179	We hope to see you back again in the future to give us a chance to earn that 5th-star rating.	
3294628	50003064	Stayed overnight on business.				
3294628	50003065	The restaurant in the hotel offers good meals.				
3294628	50003066	This is a very affordable stop.				
3294628	50003067	I would recommend if money is tight and you do not demand over the top luxury.				

3276694	50003070	Well deserved 5 stars!		80003180	Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and for all of your kind words!	
3276694	50003071	---SEP---		80003181	We are pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and hope to see you again soon!	
3276694	50003072	My family and I usually stay in a cabin/chalet in Gatlinburg but this trip centered around Dollywood and Splash County and I was determined to not fight traffic on the main strip every day.				
3276694	50003073	I booked the inn through a package on Dollywood.com.				
3276694	50003074	I liked the proximity to Dollywood AND to many restaurants that would appeal to my family (7 and 8 year old)...again, we wanted to spend our time wisely and not sit in traffic.				
3276694	50003075	EVERYTHING was on target with this inn.				
3276694	50003076	Check in/out was fast, room was clean/smelled clean, bedding/bed were very comfortable, and pools/hot tub were nice and had guest towels.				
3276694	50003077	We had a third floor balcony over the river in the part farthest from the lobby.				
3276694	50003078	It was quiet and surprisingly peaceful considering the amount of cars near us...you would never know!				
3276694	50003079	The breakfast was really good with lots of options.				
3276694	50003080	It was crowded but kudos to the employees and the hostess...				
3276694	50003081	food was hot and quickly restocked and seating was pretty plentiful.				
3276694	50003082	Here is the one place for improvement-3 to 4 more tables would be better...especially on the patio which looked like it could accommodate a bit more.				
3276694	50003083	Free popcorn and hot chocolate in the evenings were fun for the kids and one night the desk was giving out goodie bags and books to kids!				
3276694	50003084	I missed having a washer and dryer				
3276694	50003085	but this is just personal preference and no reflection on them since it is a hotel.				
3276694	50003086	I was very impressed with this place!				
3276694	50003087	I really can't see much room for improvement and will return when our travels bring us back to a hotel!				

3244035	50003090	Not impressed ---SEP---		80003192	Thanks for leaving a review.	
3244035	50003091	The hotel is in a perfect location.		80003193	Please get in touch so that I can have someone fix the issues you described with your room (particularly that old carpet, yuck!), as we do not want anyone to be welcomed in by the experiences you've described.	
3244035	50003092	However, I was not impressed.		80003194	Thank you for bringing this to my attention.	
3244035	50003093	The rooms were super small, the carpet was old and dirty (It was starting to rip apart)				
3244035	50003094	the bathroom was old.				
3244035	50003095	Overall for the price they are at you can find a better hotel.				

3229152	50003100	Great stay in Aggieland ---SEP--- Great place!		80003205	Howdy MominCCTX!	
3229152	50003101	Friendly staff.		80003206	Thanks for sharing your great stay with us.	
3229152	50003102	Very conveniently located.		80003207	We appreciate you choosing to stay with us when visiting your Corps of Cadet.	
3229152	50003103	Our daughter is in the Corps of Cadets so this is so close to the Quad.		80003208	We look forward to you visiting again and enjoying the rooftop pool	
3229152	50003104	The pool looks great.				
3229152	50003105	We will definitely bring a swim suit our next trip.				

3178944	50003110	Great views, very relaxing ---SEP---		80003219	Thank you for taking the time to write a review about us.	
3178944	50003111	Loved the location and setting.		80003220	It is pleasing to hear you enjoyed your holiday with us	
3178944	50003112	Enjoyed just sitting looking at the terrific view of the ocean, pasture and cows.				
3178944	50003113	Very clean, comfortable cottage.				
3178944	50003114	An easy 15-20 minute flat walk to the centre of town.				
3178944	50003115	The amenities lounge had a library of books and DVDs to borrow.				

3278065	50003120	Very relaxing ---SEP--- Stayed at this hotel for 1 night.		80003231	Dear CBeaton, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.	
3278065	50003121	Couldn't fault it at all.		80003232	We are delighted you enjoyed your visit & hope to welcome you again soon.	
3278065	50003122	All the staff were very helpful and friendly.		80003233	Best Regards, Chris	
3278065	50003123	The room was was absolutely amazing as was the breakfast and the complimentary cocktails.				
3278065	50003124	Will definitely be back.				

3309123	50003130	Great for Families ---SEP---		80003244	Thank you for taking the time to write your detailed review.	
3309123	50003131	We stayed for only one night on our way back from Margaret River - me and my Husband and 2 kids.		80003245	I appreciate that you have noted your pros and cons about your stay at Be Fremantle, all feedback is extremely valuable to us and we strive to improve with each stay.	
3309123	50003132	Fremantle is a lovely little town and this was a great stay for the family.		80003246	I can confirm we offer continental breakfast packs at a cost, which are delivered the night before.	
3309123	50003133	I had booked a 2 bedroom apartment and was upgraded to a 3 bedroom apartment facing the marina.		80003247	Unfortunately, we do not have an onsite restaurant, hence room service is not available by the hotel.	
3309123	50003134	Pros: - Great space.		80003248	As mentioned, we are only a short stroll away from popular local Restaurants, and our staff can recommend many places that offer delivery.	
3309123	50003135	The kitchen, dining and living room with tv and small balcony were on the first floor.		80003249	I have noted your feedback about the bathrooms.	
3309123	50003136	Kitchen was well equipped for eating and cooking and had a Nespresso and dishwasher.		80003250	I am glad that you found our property family friendly and enjoyed what our Marina view has to offer.	
3309123	50003137	Full washer dryer also with detergent provided.		80003251	I hope that you choose to stay with us next time you and your family visit Fremantle.	
3309123	50003138	Second floor was Master bedroom with TV and ensuite bathroom with large jacuzzi.		80003252	Kind Regards, Ben Fuller	
3309123	50003139	The second bedroom had 2 twin beds and there was another separate bathroom with a shower.				
3309123	50003140	Third floor had 2 twin beds but no bathroom.				
3309123	50003141	Overall rooms were a good size but not huge.				
3309123	50003142	It was all clean and functional - Amazing View of the marina and sunset - Beds very comfortable - Location was great.				
3309123	50003143	End of the marina boardwalk and walking distance to a whole bunch of seafood restaurants and the Little Creatures Brewery.				
3309123	50003144	A short drive to the Fremantle Prison and also the Fremantle Market - Quick and easy check in and check out.				
3309123	50003145	Everything was good to go for us when we checked in.				
3309123	50003146	Cons: - This is a serviced apartment not a full service hotel.				
3309123	50003147	You can order breakfast the night before but I don‚Äôt think there was any kind of on demand room service.				
3309123	50003148	That said you could walk down the boardwalk in the morning to get coffee and toast at the seafood restaurants too - Bathrooms only had one sink each and the showers didn‚Äôt have the detachable showerheads, which are helpful when you have kids -				
3309123	50003149	The parking lot is small and tight.				
3309123	50003150	And yes, they clearly indicate when you make the reservation and when you check in it‚Äôs $15 so don‚Äôt be shocked when they charge you				

3184887	50003160	A bed for the night ---SEP--- Checked in around 5.30.		80003263	Hi Richard, Thank you for your review.	
3184887	50003161	Receiption was really busy		80003264	We're happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and that checking in was still easy and efficient even during a busy period.	
3184887	50003162	but the wait was short.		80003265	Should you choose to stay again (which we hope you will!)	
3184887	50003163	Check in took just a minute then off to room.		80003266	please feel free to use our pillow menu, and one of our helpful concierges will bring some pillows up that are more to your liking.	
3184887	50003164	8th floor good size, two queen ?		80003267	Thanks again!	
3184887	50003165	Size beds.		80003268	- Catherine	
3184887	50003166	Air con was a little noisy but managed to stay on and didn't keep me awake.				
3184887	50003167	Pillows were big and not to my liking but that's just a personal thing.				
3184887	50003168	Breakfast was okay				
3184887	50003169	but not to the same standard as Rydges Auckland, again the dining room was really busy.				
3184887	50003170	Other than that the room was clean and modern and the service was good.				

3194950	50003180	Despite too many flaws, it's still 5 stars ---SEP---		80003279	Dear StPeteSaint, Thank you for taking the time to share comments with us with regards to your recent stay at our hotel.	
3194950	50003181	I admit it.		80003280	Please understand, this is not a normal level of service our guest should come to expect with the lack of material and amenities within your room package.	
3194950	50003182	I'm a critical person.		80003281	I am delighted to hear how well our front desk associate was able to assist you with addressing your concerns upon check-out.	
3194950	50003183	(Just ask my wife.)		80003282	It would be our pleasure to have another opportunity to welcome you back.	
3194950	50003184	And this weekend's stay at the Grand Hyatt was far from perfect.		80003283	Sincerely, Nick B. - Guest Relations Associate	
3194950	50003185	But I'm still giving our stay 5 stars.				
3194950	50003186	Why?				
3194950	50003187	Because sometimes it's not the problem, but the solution that is important..				
3194950	50003188	"A few weeks ago, I was reading an online article about ""Tampa away from the beach"" or something like that, and the writer was raving about the ""casitas"" at the Grand Hyatt."				
3194950	50003189	Hyatt's web site really doesn't describe the casitas, so I'll try.				
3194950	50003190	The casitas aren't physically connected to the main hotel.				
3194950	50003191	They're basically large one-room units set on one of the inlets along Tampa Bay.				
3194950	50003192	The clean lines of modern decor makes the casita seem larger than it is.				
3194950	50003193	"My wife and I decided to make a night of it: I booked a casita ""romance package,"" which was supposed to include free valet parking, a ""welcome"" bottle of champagne and either in-room breakfast for two or breakfast at the hotel's casual restaurant, Petey Brown's."				
3194950	50003194	We decided to splurge and make reservations at Oystercatchers (definitely 5 stars) for Saturday night.				
3194950	50003195	"Oh, and the casita was ""bay side,"" which makes you think you have a water view."				
3194950	50003196	You'd be mostly wrong about that.				
3194950	50003197	Your view is mangroves, with just specks of water peeking through the mangroves.				
3194950	50003198	Valet, champagne, breakfast?				
3194950	50003199	Sounds great, right?				
3194950	50003200	Let's take them one by one to see where they came up short.				
3194950	50003201	We took advantage of the valet parking, moving our bags from our car to shuttle transportation.				
3194950	50003202	When we got back to the casitas, there was a large parking lot.				
3194950	50003203	It would've been much easier for us to have our car near us instead of back by the parking garage.				
3194950	50003204	When we got to the room (2018), as soon as we walked in, a distinct musty odor hit us and we asked to change room, winding up in 2036, which was an ADA room with an open shower, which really didn't bother us as much as that musty smell did.				
3194950	50003205	Champagne?				
3194950	50003206	We never did get that bottle.				
3194950	50003207	It was never delivered to our room after check out.				
3194950	50003208	When we got back from Oystercatches (about 10 p.m.), I called the front desk.				
3194950	50003209	They apologized and said the bottle would be delivered at 10 a.m. the next morning.				
3194950	50003210	We checked out about 11 a.m. with no champagne.				
3194950	50003211	Breakfast?				
3194950	50003212	Apparently, there was supposed to be some book or form in our room that explained our breakfast choices.				
3194950	50003213	We never had that and by the time we checked out, we were ready to leave the hotel and skip all the bother of another unfulfilled offer of breakfast.				
3194950	50003214	But here's the hotel's saving grace: our checkout person.				
3194950	50003215	When she asked about our stay, I told her how disappointed I was and listed all the problems.				
3194950	50003216	She asked if there was anything she could do, and I said a price adjustment would be nice and she agreed, taking $50 (the romance package) off our bill.				
3194950	50003217	I wish I remembered her name to give her the credit she deserves.

3312818	50003240	Great place ---SEP---		80003324	Thank you for your review.	
3312818	50003241	I visited with my husband and kids while on spring break and we had an excellent time!		80003325	The night front desk agent that evening was Marcia.	
3312818	50003242	We arrived late but when we got there, they had already had our room and keys ready!		80003326	We will pass along your accolades to her.	
3312818	50003243	The lady at the front desk was so welcoming and made us feel right at home!		80003327	We are very pleased that you had a wonderful experience while staying with us.	
3312818	50003244	I can't remember her name		80003328	We hope to see you return in the future.	
3312818	50003245	but she the night attendant on March 17th!				
3312818	50003246	She went over and beyond to make sure our room was accommodating ( we was traveling with 3 children)!				
3312818	50003247	The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was absolutely the best!				
3312818	50003248	The breakfast attendants made sure that there was plenty of food out at all times and even though the hotel was fully booked, the food never ran low and the dining area wasn't very crowded!				

3269960	50003250	Quick getaway ---SEP---		80003339	So glad the kiddos were able to enjoy our pool and that the parents were able to relax with a taste of our Happy Hour!	
3269960	50003251	Our family loved Aloft!		80003340	Alofts across the world are fantastic	
3269960	50003252	Casual, eclectic atmosphere with plenty of activities for the kids.		80003341	so we hope you get to experience them all!	
3269960	50003253	They spent a few hours playing pool, chess, and visiting in the lobby.		80003342	Thank you again for the amazing review and we hope to see you in the future!	
3269960	50003254	The pool was clean and visible from not only the lobby but also our room so we could keep an eye on them while they played.				
3269960	50003255	The hotel is within walking distance to Brickopolis where we played video games and a round of mini-golf.				
3269960	50003256	Happy hour in the bar was great, the bartenders were friendly and we had great conversation.				
3269960	50003257	We are looking at staying at the Aloft hotel in Texas for our next mini-vaca.				

3248715	50003260	Banff Corral Horswback riding ---SEP---		80003353	Dear Paul G, We are so sorry that you did you not enjoy Horseback riding that we have here in Banff.	
3248715	50003261	Basically, just a step up from going around in a circle at the local carnival.		80003354	Although they are not associated with the hotel, we will pass along your commentary to their team as well as our concierge team.	
3248715	50003262	Nice enough people, but if you are doing the 60-90 minute 'ride' then prepare for horses walking in a line often along paved roadways or out back where the Banff Spings hotel staff live.		80003355	Kind regards, -Fairmont Banff Springs	
3248715	50003263	I didn't think it was worth the cost.				

3186478	50003270	Very nice hotel ---SEP---		80003366	Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely review posted recently regarding your stay with us.	
3186478	50003271	The location of this hotel is wonderful.		80003367	We are happy to read that you enjoyed our picturesque location in our bustling village of Malahide.	
3186478	50003272	The town is lovely and the hotel itself is near to the water's edge with beautiful views of the estuary, harbour and beaches.		80003368	I am also delighted to hear that you enjoyed our cuisine and that you found your room very comfortable.	
3186478	50003273	The bus from the airport stops almost at the door and the train station is a five-minute walk away with regular trains into Dublin city centre.		80003369	We hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Malahide in the near future.	
3186478	50003274	I stayed there for business but wished I had more time there!		80003370	Warmest regards, Guest Relations Manager	
3186478	50003275	The hotel was very smart and yet comfortable with some character - not just another bland corporate hotel.				
3186478	50003276	Plenty of lounge area to relax in.				
3186478	50003277	The drinks in the bar weren't overpriced.				
3186478	50003278	The breakfast buffet had plenty of variety and there were some nice touches like warm bread.				
3186478	50003279	The bedroom was very spacious, clean and freshly decorated, very comfy bed.				
3186478	50003280	The tea tray was well stocked and included biscuits.				
3186478	50003281	The bedroom felt luxurious and was a wonderful haven after being outside in a rain shower.				
3186478	50003282	The only criticism was having to pay extra for wifi.				
3186478	50003283	If that was included in the price, I don't think there would be any aspect that I could find fault with!				
3186478	50003284	I definitely want to stay here again.				

3284456	50003290	Great place to stay for families ---SEP--- Excellent accommodation for a family of four.		80003381	Hi thanks for the great review it is always really pleasing to read how much guests have enjoyed staying with us at the Lodge - and furthermore that the accommodation is well suited to families and has the required facilities like modern TV's & DVD players throughout, so that everyone can relax whilst they are on holidays!	
3284456	50003291	Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, large living with great kitchen.		80003382	We would like to explain how the Wifi / internet works as we believe Lomond Lodge offers quite a progressive service in relation to free Wifi, particularly in the Queenstown region.	
3284456	50003292	They even feature a dish washer - we loved it.		80003383	We recently upgraded our Wifi service so that all guests now receive 250MB of free Wifi usage every other day, which can be used throughout the Lodge & anywhere in the Queenstown area.	
3284456	50003293	Large offer of free DVDs with TV and DVD players in every room.		80003384	Two users can log on at anyone time and each voucher is valid for 7 days.	
3284456	50003294	Staff very friendly and helpful.		80003385	We believe we are trying to offer our guests a convenient,efficient & complimentary Wifi package to use during their stay.	
3284456	50003295	Centrally located.		80003386	We appreciate your comments and hope we can host you again next time you visit beautiful Queenstown.	
3284456	50003296	Parking space available.		80003387	Kind regards, Lee Exell Owner	
3284456	50003297	Max 5 min walk to the city center with its many restaurants.				
3284456	50003298	The only thing we did not really like: Their internet access.				
3284456	50003299	It is arcane and does not work well enough, it is much too slow and they torture one with these senseless limits.				
3284456	50003300	They should do better on this one.				
3284456	50003301	Otherwise: cool place.				

3222179	50003310	Excellent ---SEP--- I love staying at this hotel.		80003398	Thank you for staying with us at The Fort Garry and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.	
3222179	50003311	The historical charm is beautifully maintained.		80003399	We're so glad to hear you enjoyed the new changes in our rooms, and were able to experience the area as well.	
3222179	50003312	The rooms are most satisfyingly updated for a great stay.		80003400	We very much look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back again as our Guest soon.	
3222179	50003313	The location is perfect for visiting museums and places of interest close by; especially the Manitoba Legislature Building and the CPR rail station.				

3211692	50003320	A great stay ---SEP--- Clean quiet hotel with friendly efficient staff.		80003411	Hi Eamon M, thank you for taking the time to write a review of our hotel.	
3211692	50003321	Would highly recommend.		80003412	Its great to hear you enjoyed your stay, and would highly recommend us.	
3211692	50003322	Rooms are air conditioned and you will waken in the morning refreshed after a quiet nights sleep.		80003413	We look forward to welcoming you back to City East in the future!	
3211692	50003323	Also walking distance to lots of shops and supermarkets.		80003414	Kind regards, Premier Inn Team	

3199501	50003330	Outstanding Hotel ---SEP---		80003425	Dear Guest, Thank you so much for making The Palazzo your destination of choice for your Christmas holiday.	
3199501	50003331	We spent a week at the Palazzo over Christmas.		80003426	I would like to express my sincerest appreciation for your kind comments.	
3199501	50003332	The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very good.		80003427	Your feedback and your experience is a testament to our underlying passion in providing services and experiences that are truly second-to-none- not only for the holidays but for every day as well.	
3199501	50003333	The rooms are so big and comfortable.		80003428	Thank you again, and on behalf of my entire team at The Venetian |	
3199501	50003334	Location is great.		80003429	The Palazzo, we wish you and your family a joyous New Year.	
3199501	50003335	The monorail stops at Harrah's which is not a very long walk from the Palazzo.		80003430	Kind Regards, Kirsten Dimond VP of Hotel Operations	
3199501	50003336	We purchased the Prestige Suite package and it is so worth the extra money.				
3199501	50003337	Limo to and from the airport is so much better than a cab.				
3199501	50003338	Check in was extremely quick and easy.				
3199501	50003339	The lounge is great.				
3199501	50003340	It has great food and drink variety.				
3199501	50003341	We never went anywhere else for breakfast and afternoon snacks/appetizers were excellent.				
3199501	50003342	My only complaint is all the cigarette smoke in the casino, but that is the case at all hotels.				
3199501	50003343	I would absolutely stay here again.				

3181261	50003350	Excellent Stay ---SEP---		80003441	Thank you, Maria Gabriela M.	
3181261	50003351	Everything was perfect, from the moment we checked in to the time we left.		80003442	We are delighted to hear you enjoyed many aspects of your stay with Archer, especially our central location, delightful details, sincere service and Empire views.	
3181261	50003352	We want to thank especially Anthony from the reception desk.		80003443	You are so king to mention Anthony by name, we will be sure to pass your comments along to him.	
3181261	50003353	He was most helpful with all our particular needs.		80003444	Guests like you are a joy to host and we hope you will join us for another New York adventure soon.	
3181261	50003354	We loved the little details, like the bookmark for my latest acquisition.		80003445	In Hospitality, Michele - GM	
3181261	50003355	Or the cookies every night.				
3181261	50003356	And the happy hour on Saturday and Sunday.				
3181261	50003357	We will definitely return.				

3208771	50003360	Beautiful View ---SEP---		80003456	Aloha Liz and thank you for sharing your review.	
3208771	50003361	Had the best experience in this nicely renovated hotel with a beach front view.		80003457	We're delighted that you got a chance to take in our spectacular views and got to see a rainbow over the Pacific.	
3208771	50003362	I enjoyed every minute of our stay.		80003458	Our ideal location just steps away from the beach means the great views never stop.	
3208771	50003363	On the last day of my stay as I look out the window i came across a beautiful rainbow on the ocean.		80003459	We appreciate your feedback and would be happy to welcome you again for another fabulous vacation-with-a-view soon.	
3208771	50003364	It was simply breathtaking!		80003460	Mahalo and a hui hou (until next time)!	

3243757	50003370	Good value for money, really friendly staff, good size rooms ---SEP---		80003471	Dear guest Thank you for your kind comments .

3243757	50003372	Pull down bed ready made up for us.		80003473	Regards Sheena Hodgson	
3243757	50003373	My son and partner had own room.				
3243757	50003374	Both families checked in early as the 2 rooms were ready.				
3243757	50003375	Used the pool and sauna which were good, plenty clean towels, shampoo etc to use.				
3243757	50003376	Few pieces of gym equipment available for those more energetic guests who want it.				
3243757	50003377	Gym was pretty quiet Sat afternoon.				
3243757	50003378	Friendly reception and bar staff, restaurant staff really nice (even though we were little late down for breakfast on Sun morning).				
3243757	50003379	We didn't hear any noise at night even though there seemed to be a few stag parties on our floor.				
3243757	50003380	Overall, we would recommend this hotel - its about 10 min drive into Newcastle city centre (approx ¬£7.50 in taxi).				
3243757	50003381	Nice taxi drivers too!!				

3263597	50003390	Excellent hotel ---SEP---		80003484	Dear ScottK_10, Thank you for the excellent rating and review of our hotel.	
3263597	50003391	We have stayed at several Embassy Suites hotels as we are a family of 5 and the rooms there fit my family the best.		80003485	Thank you also for your loyalty to the Embassy brand.	
3263597	50003392	This was by far the best Embassy Suites we have stayed at.		80003486	I am honored to hear that we lived up to your standards.	
3263597	50003393	The hotel was beautiful, the staff was very friendly, the rooms were up to date and clean, and it was located just a few blocks to walk to the beach, shops, and restaurants.		80003487	You are absolutely right that we are not located directly on the beach.	
3263597	50003394	We loved having the free delicious breakfast (with made to order eggs) and also enjoyed the managers reception when we were able to go.		80003488	However, we are conveniently surrounded by fabulous shops and restaurants.	
3263597	50003395	The bell staff was very helpful when we needed rides to different areas of the island and the concierge staff also was great with excursions planning.		80003489	I appreciate your continued loyalty, and look forward to hosting you and your family again.	
3263597	50003396	The only way the hotel could have been better is if it was located right on Waikiki beach.		80003490	Mahalo, Bob Y	
3263597	50003397	Loved it!

3179940	50003403	Our apartment was clean, modern and gave each member of our family space.		80003504	We are indeed located in the heart of a UNESCO world heritage site and there are a few steps coming from the Royal Mile but our Team will be more than delighted to assist when needed.	
3179940	50003404	Blair provided great customer service.		80003505	I sincerely hope to welcome you back for a future stay with us in Old Town Chambers.	
3179940	50003405	There are steps to get to the place but staff were always willing to help with suitcases.		80003506	With kindest regards Alessandro Pilotti Assistant Manager

3211260	50003430	Very nice hotel close to the airport ---SEP---		80003548	Aloha f18pilot, Thank you for staying at Best Western The Plaza Hotel earlier this month and for taking the time to write a review about your experiences.	
3211260	50003431	I was booked here for business.		80003549	We are pleased to hear we were able to meet your expectations on this business trip.	
3211260	50003432	It is basically at the airport on H1!		80003550	"As you mentioned, ""the hotel has been updated and the facilities are quite nice."""	
3211260	50003433	The hotel has been updated and the facilities are quite nice.		80003551	We will be undergoing a room refresh in October of this year and we feel our guests will love what we do to the rooms.	
3211260	50003434	The have an outdoor pool and a parking garage if needed, that is secure.		80003552	Also, thank you for acknowledging the staff.	
3211260	50003435	There is a restaurant in the hotel that operates for breakfast and some days for dinner.		80003553	"As you stated, ""The staff is really great"	
3211260	50003436	The sister property one block away has a restaurant that operates the other days for dinner.		80003554	"and they bent over backwards to accommodate everyone!"""	
3211260	50003437	The staff is really great and they bent over backwards to accommodate everyone!		80003555	Our staff is always hospitable and does try to ensure all our guests are happy and comfortable!	
3211260	50003438	This hotel gets a lot of military personnel and the hotel staff is very understanding and helpful!		80003556	Thank you for staying and we look forward to welcoming you back!	
3211260	50003439	The rooms are quite large and comfortable.		80003557	Mahalo, Brent Kitsu Assistant General Manager	
3211260	50003440	They include a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker.				
3211260	50003441	They even provide ear plugs incase the highway noise bothers you!				

3267754	50003450	Good break ---SEP--- Came with friends for 2 night, 3 day break.		80003568	Dear pesue1, Thank you for your feedback, as you can appreciate the hotel is a very old building and requires a constant maintenance and refurbishment programme that does take time to complete.	
3267754	50003451	Staff were very friendly and helpful, a nice touch to have parking for our less able friends at the front of the hotel reserved, parking otherwise is under the hotel with steps up to the hotel no lift.		80003569	We are pleased that you would definitely be coming again and we look forward to welcoming you back.	
3267754	50003452	And as is the way now a payment to park your car.		80003570	Kind Regards Rachel Painter-Scott General Manager	
3267754	50003453	Our room was large, well equipped, comfortable bed, the food choice was good and tasty.				
3267754	50003454	As with a lot of hotels now it is getting tired, but well worth a visit on the deal we got.				
3267754	50003455	The position is also close to the town centre.				
3267754	50003456	Definitely coming again.				

3240350	50003460	Wanted queen beds not doubles for this night ---SEP--- Had an unexpected stay in Denver that night due to weather.		80003581	Bloomfield_ NMShearn, On crazy weather nights, it can get pretty chaotic at times.	
3240350	50003461	We were only going to be able to get about 4 hours of sleep, but would rather have that and a shower, than stay in the airport.		80003582	I'm glad that your experience on a night like that was positive.	
3240350	50003462	Lots of travelers had to do the same so the line to check in was longer than I would have liked, but oh well.		80003583	Our staff does the best that it can to try to make everyone's time here a good one, no matter what the circumstances area.	
3240350	50003463	They worked as fast and polite with what they had to deal with.		80003584	I wasn't quite sure what the title of your review meant, but I did want to assure you that the beds you slept on were queens, not doubles, if that was your concern.	
3240350	50003464	Very clean hotel, nicer amenities in bathroom, safe shuttle to/from airport, and they did have to go breakfast stuff.		80003585	We hope you'll plan another visit to our hotel for your travels through Colorado when there is less snow!	
3240350	50003465	Some we didn't have time to eat and wasn't allowed to take through security, so did pick through it.				
3240350	50003466	Was still nice to have something.				
3240350	50003467	Would stay again, but hope we had more time to sleep next time, lol .				

3289033	50003470	Overrated and confusing ---SEP---		80003596	Dear Marlene S, I am emailing you regarding your recent experience at The Riverside Hotel Fort Lauderdale.	
3289033	50003471	We spent our last night in Fort Lauderdale here on March 17th.		80003597	Having read your email, I must apologize for your experience not being as delightful as you had expected de to the situations you cited.	
3289033	50003472	It is really confusing to know where to go, to get into the hotel for the lobby.		80003598	Please note that your feedback is important to us as this is a gift and we will ensure all your concerns are addressed with the relevant departments to ensure that no other guest leaves with the same experience.	
3289033	50003473	Parking must be done by valet and it is costly - $30 - no other options.		80003599	Our Valet prices are if not the most economical in the areas as we do set our rates to match industry standards.	
3289033	50003474	No bell service looking to help us with our bags at all.		80003600	Once again, we regret that you left without bringing these concerns to our attention as we would have loved the opportunity to address then prior to your departure.	
3289033	50003475	We got checked in, got our room key but folks failed to tell us that you HAVE to use your room key, to make the elevator work.		80003601	We do ask for your forgiveness and hope that given the opportunity, we will be better able to serve you in the future.	
3289033	50003476	Would have been nice to have known that before stressing out and having to walk the stairs with all of our luggage.		80003602	Regards,	
3289033	50003477	Again, no one bothered to see if they could help.				
3289033	50003478	Our room was minuscule and it overlooked all the air conditioners.				
3289033	50003479	Butt ugly view and noisy with the air conditioners all going.				
3289033	50003480	Mind you, the room furniture is beautiful and the bed was super comfortable.				
3289033	50003481	I loved the old charm and pictures on the walls but the staff have to get a move on here.				
3289033	50003482	For the same price, I should have stayed on the beach.				
3289033	50003483	I do love the Las Olas Boulevard area				
3289033	50003484	but I'd come back to visit via the water taxi and not stay here.				

3322598	50003490	Great property, nice people - excellent experience!		80003613	Jenn Wow what a great and detailed review of the hotel!	
3322598	50003491	"---SEP--- Picked this hotel because my travel companion had about a bazillion Hilton points, so we thought ""why not go a little nicer than normal""."		80003614	I am glad that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3322598	50003492	We were not disappointed.		80003615	I am a big believer that its the staff that makes the real difference.	
3322598	50003493	"Hotel is technically located in Miramar Beach I believe, it's about 5 miles east of what I think of as ""Destin proper"" (i.e. all the Destin condos and touristy activities)."		80003616	We have so much to offer for those wanting to get away.	
3322598	50003494	It is conveniently located and easy to get to and from any place we wanted to go.		80003617	I love the hotels location as we are so close to so much to do yet not surrounded by all of the congestion that can sometimes happen in Destin.	
3322598	50003495	I aslo think that maybe being away from the main tourist area was a good thing - not a huge amount of activity going on around the hotel.		80003618	I have always said we are 100-150 yards to the beach and happened to have a carpet cleaning contractor here and borrowed his measuring tool.	
3322598	50003496	Don't get me wrong, the area isn't desolate, but there isn't a hotel every 10 feet either.		80003619	From the front door of the hotel to the gate at the walkover we are 220 yards.	
3322598	50003497	The outside of the hotel isn't particuarly remarkable, but the inside is very nice.		80003620	You are correct there are several stairs that you have to go up and down to get over the dunes that protect us in case of bad weather.	
3322598	50003498	Having never stayed at an Embassy Suites before, maybe this was typical, but all of the rooms open onto a central atrium that was very nice and well appointed.		80003621	There is wheel chair accessible access just up the road at the access by Whales tail.	
3322598	50003499	Lots of greenery and comfortable seating in that atrium, with a glass roof to allow for a lot of natural lighting during the day.		80003622	I know there are motorized beach wheelchairs available for rent in the area as well.	
3322598	50003500	"The rooms themselves are indeed ""suites"" - there s a fair-sized living area as you enter, with a sleeper sofa, an arm chair, and an ottoman, along with a ""dining"" table with 3 chairs, plus a TV on top of a cabinet that contains the safe and other extras."		80003623	Thanks so much for staying with us and I hope when you have the chance that you come back and see us again.	
3322598	50003501	In the middle portion, the large bathroom is off to one side through a door (with a closet just outside the bathroom), an opposite the bathroom door is a wet bar with a coffee maker, bar sink, mini fridge, and some draws and cabinets.		80003624	Rich Johnston General Manager	
3322598	50003502	Finally, in the back of the suite through another door is the bedroom.				
3322598	50003503	We had a double queen, and the room still felt very large.				
3322598	50003504	In the room was an additional vanity/sink/mirror combo, plus another TV and chest of drawers, and an additional closet.				
3322598	50003505	The whole suite was much more than we were expecting, plenty of room for two, and a whole family of 4-6 could probably stay comfortably.				
3322598	50003506	The separate bedroom is definitely a good thing, as I tend to get up much earlier than my traveling companion, so I was able to get up, close the door, and then not have to worry so much about tiptoeing around the room.to avoid disturbing her.				
3322598	50003507	In addition to the really nice rooms, the hotel offers a very nice free breakfast buffet every morning.				
3322598	50003508	Good selection of hot dishes (eggs, sausage, pancakes, etc.), plus some made-to-order stuff (eggs and omelets), oatmeal, fresh fruit, cereal, baked goods, etc.				
3322598	50003509	It was quite a selection, especially to be included in the price of the room.				
3322598	50003510	"There's also a ""reception"" every evening from 5:30 to 7:30 that included light snacks (chips and dip, pretzels, chips and salsa, etc.) and some alcoholic beverages (beers, a few mixed drinks, etc.)."				
3322598	50003511	We tried to hit this every night, wanted to get our money's worth!				
3322598	50003512	=0)				
3322598	50003513	"Hotel also has a private access to the beach - note that this doesn't mean ""private beach"" . . ."				
3322598	50003514	just a hotel-specific path too the beach that is gated.				
3322598	50003515	It's a fairly easy walk if you are able-bodied, but it's easily 500 yards from front entrance of the hotel, across a fairly busy street, along a parking lot, up a ramp, and down about 30 stairs.				
3322598	50003516	I would say it is not wheelchair accessible, and if you can't walk distances or up and down stairs, you might have issues.				
3322598	50003517	Also not a place where parents are going to be able to send their younger kids (thinking under 13 or so) back and forth without an adult or older child along.				
3322598	50003518	The hotel has beach towels available for guests for no charge - get as many as you like, but you need to sign them out and in.				
3322598	50003519	They didn't seem to care how many you took or how often you exchanged them.				
3322598	50003520	They were pretty nice towels, so if you want to travel light, leave yours at home and use theirs.				
3322598	50003521	Once you get to the beach, it is, of course, very nice (it's Destin, after all).				
3322598	50003522	There are chairs and umbrella rentals available (charge to your room or pay on the spot), along with a few water sport things to rent (kayaks, paddle boards, etc.).				
3322598	50003523	We were very happy at the beach.				
3322598	50003524	Finally, I did use the fitness room for several days, as the weather wasn't great while we were there.				
3322598	50003525	I don't have a lot of experience with hotel fitness rooms, but this one seems very nice.				
3322598	50003526	It had a multi-exercise weight machine, some weighted ball and a few dumbells, plus a couple of treadmills, an elliptical, and a bike.				
3322598	50003527	I used the treadmills and they were extremely nice - lots of different programs, and you could watch a TV channel right on your treadmill using headphones.				
3322598	50003528	I only have two minor complaints - first is that the walls of the rooms seemed unusually thin for this quality of hotel.				
3322598	50003529	We couldn't hear exactly what the people next door were saying or watching on TV, but we could hear that they were talking and watching TV.				
3322598	50003530	"Second would be that if you had someone sleeping on the ""hide-a-bed"" in the living room portion of the suite, they may find that the noise from the central atrium might be a little disturbing."				
3322598	50003531	It wasn't terrible, but there was a lot of echoing and such that you could hear through the door, and in the morning during breakfast, it was definitely noticeable in the room.				
3322598	50003532	Other than that, no complaints, will absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to others!				

3212826	50003540	excellent ---SEP--- me and my family went to broken hill for a week and we stayed at the lodge outback motel ..		80003635	Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3212826	50003541	the kids loved the pool and it was great to sit back and relax ... the manger Chris was so lovely an helped with every need.. my family an I will be staying here again thanks for a great stay		80003636	We are very happy that you and your family had a great experience at the motel.	
3212826				80003637	We make it a priority to ensure our guests feel that they experience a home away from home.	
3212826				80003638	Thanks again	

3305441	50003550	Well-needed family break ---SEP---		80003649	Hi Thanks for your kind words about Sands, I'm glad that you and your family got the most from holiday.	
3305441	50003551	The hotel is excellent.		80003650	With regard to the gym we previously had a small gym with limited equipment that was free.	
3305441	50003552	It seems to cater well for both families and couples as there are many different dining options, room types and bar/lounge areas.		80003651	We canvassed guests to see if they would be happy to pay for the use of a modern gym with air conditioning and the overiding response was that a ¬£10 charge for the length of the holiday was reasonable.	
3305441	50003553	This was our first ever hotel visit with 3 children and after a stressful start (baby's sleeping bag left at home), we soon relaxed.		80003652	The gym cost over ¬£100,000 to build and has high ongoing maintanance costs to keep the state of the art equipment safe, clean and up to date.	
3305441	50003554	The rooms are excellent and the childrens' room has plenty of room, good sized beds and a proper door between it and the rest of the room (bathroom and parents' room).		80003653	Without the small charge we make we would not be able to provide such a nice gym.	
3305441	50003555	We used the childcare once and the children really enjoyed the childrens' club and wanted to go back.		80003654	I hope you enjoyed the new equipment.	
3305441	50003556	The pool is not particularly large but although the hotel was full, we only ever shared it with one other family.		80003655	Regards Nicholas Malcolm	
3305441	50003557	There are plenty of areas inside and outside to relax and for the children to play.				
3305441	50003558	It is also very close to 2 excellent beaches - Porth and Watergate Bay and you can walk from the hotel by crossing a fairly quiet road or drive a few minutes to get to the nearest.				
3305441	50003559	I was surprised about the negative comments about breakfast which we thought was really good and catered for just about every taste.				
3305441	50003560	The evening a la carte meals were excellent and we really enjoyed our childfree dinner every night (we made use of the baby listening service).				
3305441	50003561	There was also great live entertainment (2 local singers) on the Saturday night which we were surprised we enjoyed so much.				
3305441	50003562	There were a few negatives - we were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and were really irritated as we had to keep the children occupied in our room for a full hour longer than we needed to) and the fact that you have to pay to use the gym - a small thing but feels really penny pinching.				
3305441	50003563	But these were outweighed by the positives - great friendly staff, fantastic food, lovely rooms, great atmosphere - and we would definitely like to return.				

3215855	50003570	Phoenix Raceway Stay ---SEP--- Great place to stay.		80003666	Dear Best Western Traveler, Thank you for staying with us and your kind comments.	
3215855	50003571	Good location.		80003667	We here at the Best Western InnSuites Phoenix Hotel have a great team that works very hard to ensure all of our guest feel at home.	
3215855	50003572	Close to restaurants, airport, downtown.		80003668	We appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon!!	
3215855	50003573	Beautiful property.		80003669	Warm regards, Mila Stouffer mstouffer@innsuites.com 602-997-6285 ext.	
3215855	50003574	Helpful staff.		80003670	309	
3215855	50003575	Quiet.				
3215855	50003576	Went to PIR and met up with friends from Minneapolis.				
3215855	50003577	Our friends commented on our room.				
3215855	50003578	"They said, ""we're staying here next time"" your room is much better than ours!"				

3325102	50003580	Great value for money ---SEP--- Visiting Glasgow with my daughter we stayed for one night.		80003681	Hello Angelaelained, Thank you for the great 5* review!	
3325102	50003581	The location was perfect, the room spotless and the staff really helpful and friendly.		80003682	We are very glad you enjoyed your stay with us, the location of the hotel is fantastic!	
3325102	50003582	We would definitely recommend for an overnight stay in the city.		80003683	Glasgow has a great shopping scene and with all the shops literally on our doorstep, you don't have to carry your shopping too long, drop your new things off and go back out and shop some more!	
3325102				80003684	:)	
3325102				80003685	We hope you come back and stay with us!	
3325102				80003686	Remember to book with us direct on our website to receive your A-List discount!	
3325102				80003687	Amy	

3178491	50003590	Can't wait to go back ---SEP---		80003698	Thank you for the kind words, Linda.	
3178491	50003591	We absolutely loved this place!		80003699	It makes us very happy that we proved an ideal host for you during your special occasion, and that you enjoyed the suite and our Bistro so much.	
3178491	50003592	We spent 2 nights in the King Valley suite with fireplace for our elopement.		80003700	We look forward to seeing you again during your next visit to Banff.	
3178491	50003593	The staff is wonderful, very friendly, checking in was fast and simple.				
3178491	50003594	The restaurant was amazing, plenty to choose from and everything was delicious.				
3178491	50003595	We had lunch and dinner, and then came back the next day because it was so good. :-)				
3178491	50003596	The fireplace in the suite made it nice and cozy and we loved the jacuzzi and rain shower.				
3178491	50003597	The room was very stylish and clean and the view is fantastic.				
3178491	50003598	We never heard any noise from other suites.				
3178491	50003599	We can not wait to go back, this was hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed at.				

3247727	50003600	Bed Bugs ---SEP---		80003711	We aren't positive that we spoke with you or not.	
3247727	50003601	We stayed in the same room two different times and brought home bed bugs, we spent $2,000.00 ==+ trying to get rid of them the worse nightmare		80003712	If you call our hotel and give us information on your trip we would like to look further into this issue (865-868-0525).	
3247727	50003602	I have ever experienced.		80003713	Anytime a bug issue is reported to us, our maintenance or housekeeping staff verifies the problem and we have professionals come to our property to eliminate all bugs.	
3247727	50003603	We called the motel and they denied it.		80003714	Like all hotels in the industry we are subject to bed bugs but we are very proactive in removing them and our housekeepers and inspectors are trained to look for them.	
3247727	50003604	But we had not been any where else but there Will never go there again.				
3247727	50003605	My advise if you go take a flash light and look in the room everywhere, they like dark places.				

3191572	50003610	60's Character Surprisingly Cool ---SEP--- Stayed here for several nights while at a conference at the university and tired of 'conference' hotels, this was walkable to campus and in a beautiful treed neighborhood just off the main road, which is a college student residential area- but not this street.		80003725	Thank you for this review,	
3191572	50003611	It was an older home built as a duplex that was renovated for the hotel use....maybe in the 1960's.		80003726	Yes it is real scrambled eggs - made with real fresh eggs.	
3191572	50003612	Quiet and a welcome degree of solitude except one night when the upper room was a bit frisky.		80003727	I don't know how a bedroom is frisky it must be my age.	
3191572	50003613	The inside is dated in some ways...but amazing with things like a pants press and very cool furnishings-		80003728	Gordon Jowett M.D.	
3191572	50003614	comfortable and well taken care of.				
3191572	50003615	Bath sizable and well appointed.				
3191572	50003616	Breakfast was a good variety for buffet [not sure if real scrambled eggs] where you can assemble a full English breakfast with sausage and bacon and with extremely courteous wait staff.				
3191572	50003617	Desk staff especially helpful with our numerous questions and insights into local color.				
3191572	50003618	Small garden/sitting area in front yard screen from the street where we ate take-out from one of local places.				

3218663	50003620	Aspen Court ---SEP---		80003739	Hi Travelgirl.	
3218663	50003621	The staff here was very friendly, and the room was very comfortable.		80003740	Thanks for the review.	
3218663	50003622	The town is quite small.		80003741	Yes once again our apologies for the broken window on the sliding door to your room.	
3218663	50003623	So, it's very easy to walk to all of the attractions from this home base.		80003742	Being a small village in an isolated region does have its drawbacks when trying to get contractors down to fix things like broken windows etc.	
3218663	50003624	The glass on our sliding door was cracked and fixed with tape, but this wasn't a problem for us.		80003743	Glad to hear it didn't detract from an enjoyable stay	

3282921	50003630	First Class lodging, wonderful staff, outstanding service ---SEP--- Very peaceful, relaxing, beautiful spacious rooms, The breakfast buffet (included in the room rate) was one of the best I've had in any lodging - plentiful eggs, omelets made to order, sausage pancakes, potatoes, and lots of fresh continental breakfast items and beverages.		80003754	Dear 611sharonj: Thank you for choosing to stay at The Bellmoor, and for taking time to submit your review.	
3282921	50003631	Enjoyed being a block from the main part of town, and the staff gave great suggestions for dinner ( Salt Air; Dogfish Ale House and their new restaurant - Chesapeake and Maine)		80003755	We're extremely pleased that your accommodations, along with our service, all met with your expectations.	
3282921	50003632	But their are so many great restaurants - and the beach - just a short walk away.		80003756	The Bellmoor is conveniently located to everything that Rehoboth Beach has to offer, with so many wonderful shops and restaurants within a short walk.	
3282921	50003633	We will return, soon I hope!		80003757	We also will hope to see you again soon, the next time your travels bring you back to the area.	

3245570	50003640	Clean and perfect ---SEP--- Brilliant hotel.		80003768	Hi alouise1996, Great to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and found the team really friendly.	
3245570	50003641	Stayed here with my boyfriend and everything was clean and perfect!		80003769	Its also great to hear the cheese and wine is much appreciated as it is a little gift from us.	
3245570	50003642	Even got some complimentary cheese and wine!		80003770	Please come back and stay again soon !	
3245570	50003643	Staff were very friendly and helped us within our stay!		80003771	Kind Regards Dan	
3245570	50003644	Will definitely consider this hotel when staying in Glasgow again.				

3279161	50003650	Sir Stamford at Circular Quay ---SEP---		80003782	Dear S3218NWsueb, Thank you very much for posting your comments on TripAdvisor and I'm delighted to learn that you were impressed with our stylish guestrooms!	
3279161	50003651	A wonderful hotel to stay in with old style features but modern day comforts and excellent service.		80003783	I do hope we didnt over serve at breakfast.	
3279161	50003652	The breakfast bar was overwhelming with a wide variety of choices and the staff constantly asking if there was anything else they could do for us.		80003784	The staff are very keen to please.	
3279161				80003785	I hope you had a chance to explore Sydney.	
3279161				80003786	You may experience the best local food, and fashion by Aussie designers within walking distance from our hotel.	
3279161				80003787	Thank you once again for sharing your experience with us and we look forward to welcoming you again soon!	
3279161				80003788	Best regards, Timothy Buckton General Manager	

3172671	50003660	Luxury Luxury Luxury!		80003799	Dear Wiley_Irish_Guy, Many thanks for taking the time to post a review of your recent stay with us at The Merrion.	
3172671	50003661	---SEP---		80003800	I have shared your wonderful comments with all the team here who join me in saying a ‚Äúbig thank you‚Äù also.	
3172671	50003662	We has a very enjoyable night in The Merrion, when we stayed recently, attending the Bruce Springsteen show in Dublin.		80003801	I am delighted that The Merrion was your favourite hotel of your holidays	
3172671	50003663	We had two rooms and they were both finished to a very high standard, and so so comfortable.		80003802	and I hope we have the privilege of welcoming you back to stay with us again at some point in the future.	
3172671	50003664	Due to the timing of the concert, we could only dine in the cellar bar, where the food was excellent, and the service top notch.		80003803	Yours sincerely, Peter Mac Cann General Manager	
3172671	50003665	We have just returned from holidays this week, where we stayed in some good hotels in London and the Caribbean, but none as good as The Merrion, which caters for your every need.				
3172671	50003666	Our only regret, was that we did not have more time to spend in the hotel, but hey, there is always the next time.				
3172671	50003667	In summary, there is only one word to describe this hotel - Classy (with a capital C).				

3270226	50003670	Great Location ---SEP--- Came back for our eight wedding anniversary with our daughter.		80003814	Thank you Bellafortuna for taking the time to share your experience with us.	
3270226	50003671	We enjoyed this hotel the first time and except for some updating, nothing has changed.		80003815	We are so pleased to hear that you enjoyed our location and friendly staff.	
3270226	50003672	The front desk was very helpful and accommodating and the room was clean, The things I love most about this hotel is that the location is so central that beach, shopping and restaurants are just steps from the front door.		80003816	We miss you too and hope to welcome you back to the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel soon.	
3270226	50003673	Miss it already.		80003817	Mahalo!	

3238350	50003680	Worst hotel in the world!!!		80003828	This review is histrionic and unhelpful as a result - more so as I was party to the dialogue with our manager.	
3238350	50003681	---SEP--- Have just checked out of this hotel and only checked in a couple of hours before hand.		80003829	These so called guests did not give the hotel an opportunity to offer them an alternative and in any event, the room they had been allocated was one of our executive rooms and is always reserved by our best customer who has been visiting for years and is especially discerning The fact that alternative accommodation was booked in advance of their speaking to our manager speaks volumes.	
3238350	50003682	Booked in for four nights this week but it was so so bad we decided to cut our losses and loose money rather than stay a single night there.		80003830	Their behaviour has made us aghast	
3238350	50003683	Grossest shabbiest building iv been in for a long time.				
3238350	50003684	Listen to all the reviews on this website as they are all true and I wish we had listened.				
3238350	50003685	We're on honeymoon and it has ruined the start of it.				
3238350	50003686	The rooms are filthy and stenchey and when we sat on the bed it was lumpy and uneven.				
3238350	50003687	Requested to speak to manager and the man on the desks reply was : depends what its regarding.				
3238350	50003688	Think reception must get hundreds of complaints as they didn't seem surprised orbothered.				
3238350	50003689	Told the man we were checking out and he replied that they have 78 rooms and some have been renovated and some haven't.				
3238350	50003690	Well in my opinion they shouldn't put people in the non renovated rooms until the renovated ones are full which they cant be if they were able to move us.				
3238350	50003691	By this point I was too disgusted at the staffs attitudes that I just wanted to get out of there and I wouldn't have given them the time of day to give us another room.				
3238350	50003692	Honestly felt like we were in their way and they couldn't be bothered to listen.				
3238350	50003693	Cups in room looked unwashed, paint round windows all peeling off, toilet unflushed, we both felt like they needed help decorating rather than guests.				
3238350	50003694	If you have a mobility issue this is seriously not the hotel for you.				
3238350	50003695	Reception couldn't have been less helpful or less interested if they tried.				
3238350	50003696	So disgraceful that they even exist as a business				
3238350	50003697	and I would never ever step foot in there again even if u paid me.				
3238350	50003698	Awful awful awful!!!!

3305463	50003730	Nice Hotel ---SEP--- Stayed here over the bank holiday, really enjoyed it, I would recommend the upper deck rooms definitely.		80003854	Thank you for you review about your recent stay with us.	
3305463	50003731	I liked that you got extras like the star bucks drink and use of the pool.		80003855	I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that you found the upper deck upgrade to be of value.	
3305463	50003732	My favourite was the sky in the rooms, really good accessory to have, I have never stayed in a hotel that has this so that was impressive.		80003856	I have taken on board your feedback with regards to the extras in the room and we are currently investigating the possibility of upgrading them.	
3305463	50003733	Just a couple of small things that didn't make a difference but thought would mention, firstly the bose dock is only for iphone 4s which I think needs updating as most people now probably have the iphone 5 or higher!!				
3305463	50003734	also the light underneath the door and through the key hole is very bright to the point we had to use pillows and a water bottle cap to cover it.				
3305463	50003735	Thank you also to the restaurant staff who honoured a voucher for the restaurant it was much appreciated.				
3305463	50003736	Overall good stay				

3232843	50003740	Excellent choice ---SEP--- Close to the airport, very good rooms, good breakfast, great staff and excellent shuttle service.		80003867	Thank you so much for leaving such a great review, It's amazing to hear feedback.	
3232843	50003741	Everything necessary was provided in the rooms.		80003868	How did the staff do?accommodating I hope?	
3232843	50003742	The breakfast was great value.		80003869	Did the front desk or the drivers inform you about our restaurant shuttle services?	
3232843	50003743	The staff were very helpful.		80003870	I hope to hear more about the stay shared here on trip advisor.	
3232843	50003744	And above all the shuttle service was reliable and easy.		80003871	feel free to contact us at 480-829-0700	

3261794	50003750	Lovely B&B, a little more businesslike than the last time we were here.		80003882	Thank you so much for coming back and staying with us here at the Capitol Hill Mansion Bed and Breakfast Inn.	
3261794	50003751	---SEP---		80003883	My daughter Bailey and I try to make each experience a memorable one for each guest and that‚Äôs why we get a lot of return guests.	
3261794	50003752	We were back in this B&B after 4 years.		80003884	I do apologize that it did not feel like home since the last time you were here four (4) years ago.	
3261794	50003753	The last time we were here, we loved the place, so we loved to come back.		80003885	I had installed a commercial kitchen in the basement, so yes, I could have been trying to get Bailey‚Äôs attention on food request.	
3261794	50003754	This is still a beautiful place with funny owners.		80003886	I am glad you enjoyed the food as well when you where here the first time.	
3261794	50003755	But the experience was different than the last time.		80003887	We always accommodate from gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan requests.	
3261794	50003756	It felt more businesslike and less personal.		80003888	I believe the guests that you mentioned said they do not eat sweets, therefore they had fresh fruit and went back upstairs quickly.	
3261794	50003757	After two days we came back and someone shouted from the basement who we were and whether we already checked inn.		80003889	We always offer an alternative menu to what the chef (Carl) is cooking each day.	
3261794	50003758	As I said we already were there for two days, so that is not really personal and attentive.		80003890	We look forward to seeing you again when your back in Denver.	
3261794	50003759	The breakfast was still great.		80003891	Carl and Bailey	
3261794	50003760	One of the guests did not want a sweet breakfast and there was no alternative.				
3261794	50003761	For me that is a bit too rigid.				
3261794	50003762	I would expect a more guest friendly approach.				
3261794	50003763	The last time (4 years ago) this all felt very different.				

3219998	50003770	Nice little get away ---SEP---		80003902	Thank you for the feedback and for making us part of your once a year tradition.	
3219998	50003771	My wife and I get to the beach once a year in October we found this gem 2 years ago.		80003903	We are centrally located near many great restaurants and shops, as well as just a few blocks from the boardwalk.	
3219998	50003772	The cottage is a nice room and looks out on the quad very nice.		80003904	It's easy to park your car and walk everywhere you wish to go.	
3219998	50003773	Highly recommended close to the boardwalk and food.		80003905	We can't wait to see you again next year!	

3162199	50003780	Stayed here on business, will be back!		80003916	dfwwaterrestoration, Thank you so much for taking the time to post about your experience on Trip Advisor, we truly appreciate your feedback.	
3162199	50003781	---SEP---		80003917	We will be sure to read your review to our team in our daily stand-up.	
3162199	50003782	I wanted a hotel that was close to everything I was going to be doing whileI was in OKC on business, and Embassy Suites could not have been a better choice.		80003918	We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel soon.	
3162199	50003783	The management and staff are to be commended on the whole experience, from the welcome to the exit.		80003919	Regards, Christian H	
3162199	50003784	I will definitely be back in the future, and plan to make this my go to hotel in OKC!				

3247053	50003790	Great location, everything it needs but tired.		80003920	Thank you so much for your great feedback.	
3247053	50003791	---SEP---		80003921	So happy you had such a great stay with us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.	
3247053	50003792	Great location by George Sq and Queen Street Station.				
3247053	50003793	A bit of a wait at check in but once there pleasant staff.				
3247053	50003794	Good free wifi.				
3247053	50003795	Rooms were very tired with old furniture and flaky paint.				
3247053	50003796	Having said that everything you needed was there and it was clean and tidy.				
3247053	50003797	Comfy big bed.				
3247053	50003798	Very tasty breakfast delivered on time via room service.				
3247053	50003799	Would stay again.				

3247462	50003800	worst hotel experience ever ---SEP---		80003932	SKHively thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience.	
3247462	50003801	We booked 3 rooms for 4 days.		80003933	Please accept our deepest apologies for the troubles you faced during your stay with us in Oklahoma City.	
3247462	50003802	They couldn't even put them on the same floor (two on third and one on eighth).		80003934	The opening of our pool was delayed by several weeks due to the record amounts of rainfall we received in May.	
3247462	50003803	This is a 10 floor hotel with 2 elevators and only 1 worked.		80003935	That has since been solved.	
3247462	50003804	Outdoor pool was closed for the season in June.		80003936	We will have a full sit down with our whole staff to revisit our hotel as a whole.	
3247462	50003805	Beds are hard.		80003937	As you can see from our many reviews, our hotel is an amazing place to stay as it offers guests a tremendous view of the Oklahoma City skyline.	
3247462	50003806	No table or seeting in room.		80003938	We do hope that you give us another chance as we are sure to impress.	
3247462	50003807	The breakfast was mediocre at best and if you wanted it you needed to b early because they ran out and did not refill.				
3247462	50003808	On our first outing they deactivated all of our room keys and we all had to go back down to get them reset and then in my room the housekeeping staff had locked out bathroom door shut				
3247462	50003809	and when i called the desk the obviously foreign speaking girl did not believe me and had to come see it for herself even though she knew she did not have the key and could not fix it				
3247462	50003810	and then her solution was to move us to another room - what a hassle in the first place, but it still did not resolve the fact that all of our toiletries were still going to be locked in that bathroom!				
3247462	50003811	The next day the two rooms on the 3rd floor had to leave their rooms during the day so the plumbing could be worked on.				
3247462	50003812	The decor was outdated and what updates they had attempted were cheaply done.				
3247462	50003813	Their General Manager was extremely unprofessional and rude - One of the other guests who is my sister has a daughter whose hair is dyed a very bright red				
3247462	50003814	and unfortunately it bled onto the bedding leaving a pinkish discoloration and they checked out before us and the general manager told me to inform her they are billing her an additional $150 cleaning fee for it - I told her that was her job not mine and made her call her to inform her of it				
3247462	50003815	and then i listened to her basically call my sister a liar because she did not believe it was from hair dye.				
3247462	50003816	I will never use this hotel again and encourage everyone else to avoid it.				
3247462	50003817	I have stayed at other hotels of this brand and they were fine, but not this one!				

3286822	50003820	Hotel - NEEDS HELP - OUTDATED, PLUMBING BAD - ---SEP--- Visited for a wedding, and we had a nice time, however hotel is showing wear - carpets dirty, plumbing in dire need of help.		80003949	We appreciate your time in writing your review.	
3286822	50003821	Two of us were moved to a different room due to plumbing issues, however one of us had to be moved again (yes twice) due to plumbing.		80003950	We are happy to hear you enjoyed your time with the wedding party.	
3286822	50003822	Time to invest some money or close I would say.		80003951	We apologize for the plumbing and the cleanliness of our hotel.	
3286822				80003952	We have noted your complaints regarding the condition of our hotel, and we are making the changes necessary to ensure that the quality of our facility is kept up to the highest standard.	

3242159	50003830	fantastic hotel ---SEP--- just returned from Blue Horizon, hotel is on Robson with restaurants and bars aplenty, something to suit everybody and budget from $-$$$$$, 5 min walk from Davie Village, 10 min walk to entrance Stanley Park and 5 mins to Coal Harbor/Canada Place, very compact downtown city and easy to get around as it is laid out grid system.		80003963	Dear paul w, Wonderful to hear you had a 5/5 experience at our fabulous hotel!	
3242159	50003831	i found the hotel itself fabulous, huge bedrooms and each room is a corner room with balcony and wonderful views, bathrooms are being updated which is needed, the staff are wonderful and friendly and nothing is a problem if you need assistance or ask for help with directions etc.		80003964	Our friendly staff appreciate your kind words.	
3242159	50003832	highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Vancouver.		80003965	Robson Street is Vancouver's favourite pedestrian friendly street offering a variety that comes from linking the downtown business center to the residential West End community.	
3242159				80003966	As you mention, something for everybody.	
3242159				80003967	We look forward to welcoming you back.	

3295251	50003840	Quintessential, cozy inn atmosphere ---SEP---		80003978	Thank you for your wonderful review...	
3295251	50003841	We happened upon the inn on our way into town before a big storm- what a pleasant surprise!		80003979	I really love hearing when we impress our guests and help them to enjoy the destination at hand.	
3295251	50003842	"The food was amazing- my husband declared ""pizza made the top 5 of his life!"""		80003980	Even more important to us is that this was your first visit to this corner of BC and that you were on a mission to discover even more of the beautiful nearby coastal attractions.	
3295251	50003843	Jeremy, the owner, couldn't be nicer!		80003981	I hope that you enjoyed them all, particularly Tofino!	
3295251	50003844	He obviously cares a lot about his inn and his guests, by the thoughtfulness that he put into the restoration and the time he takes to talk with everyone, remembering our names.		80003982	Regards, Jeremy	
3295251	50003845	We will definitely be back!				
3295251	50003846	It felt like our little home away from home...				
3295251	50003847	ask for room #3- complete with fireplace and private washroom.				

3183092	50003850	Great weekend away ---SEP---		80003993	Its lovely to receive such positive comments.

3254069	50003874	The room was large and clean, staff was welcoming and helpful.				
3254069	50003875	The booking was excellent value for the location.				
3254069	50003876	We would definitely stay there again.				

3197741	50003880	Great spot, wonderful hosts and Comfortable accommodation ---SEP---		80004036	Thanks for the fantastic review!	
3197741	50003881	Whilst working in Bowen, I had the privilege of living at the Sky View Units for a duration of 2 years and 2 months.		80004037	We couldn't have asked for a better long term resident at Sky View, and look forward to you visiting us again soon.	
3197741	50003882	The unit I stayed in became my home and I couldn't have asked for a better place to live.				
3197741	50003883	Cheap, self contained and very comfortable two bedroom, kitchen, dining and lounge area, cleaned on a weekly basis.				
3197741	50003884	Great swimming pool and BBQ area, laundry facilities and undercover parking with a beautiful beach directly across the road.				
3197741	50003885	Great for swimming and fishing.				
3197741	50003886	All that said, a must to mention is 'Shane and Jackie' - the unit managers, wonderful people that made me feel welcome and part of the community from day one.				
3197741	50003887	I consider them great friends and thank them immensely for their sincere hospitality.				
3197741	50003888	They would always go out of their way to assist me in anything I needed.

3313303	50003890	Very nice but.... ---SEP---		80004048	Thank you for taking the time to complete this review.	
3313303	50003891	The lobby and hotel are very nice.		80004049	We appreciate your comments although are disheartened by the issues you experienced during your stay.	
3313303	50003892	The rooms excellent with very comfortable beds.		80004050	We truly value your feedback and will share your comments with the appropriate team members.	
3313303	50003893	Bathrooms spotless as you would expect.		80004051	We hope that you will give us another opportunity to be of service the next time your travel plans bring you to Charlotte.	
3313303	50003894	Location a bit lacking in places to walk to for dinner or shopping but overall the area is nice.				
3313303	50003895	Workout room is excellent and they have a decent pool that they do keep warm (thank you).				
3313303	50003896	Now the buts...				
3313303	50003897	The coffee maker is a new item and is a disaster.				
3313303	50003898	It says push the lit symbol lightly...				
3313303	50003899	You have to mash down on it for it to work.				
3313303	50003900	That is if you can squeeze a coffee cup in.				
3313303	50003901	The coffee cups are too tall.				
3313303	50003902	The expression cups are okay.				
3313303	50003903	To get the coffe cup to fit you can remove the silver grate that the cup sits on and wedge in you cup there that should work.				
3313303	50003904	I also had the toilet paper holder fall off, just not my night.				
3313303	50003905	The retaining ring must have failed, it was okay				
3313303	50003906	I just rolled off the paper.				
3313303	50003907	"I would certainly recommend this hotel and only gave it a 4 for failing to be able to offer a normal coffee maker for those who don't want to mess with the ""mod"" one."				
3313303	50003908	If u find this helpful please mark it so.				
3313303	50003909	Thanks Berny				

3200335	50003910	Best location, grand art deco style and peaceful ---SEP---		80004062	Dear surfKiev, We're delighted to learn that you enjoyed an exceptional vacation with us here at The Royal Hawaiian.	
3200335	50003911	For me this place was a fantastic treat.		80004063	Thank you for taking the time to share your thorough review regarding your stay.	
3200335	50003912	I will first explain what makes this place great		80004064	We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.	
3200335	50003913	and then what some travelers may not want.		80004065	Warmest aloha,	
3200335	50003914	The Great: First, this hotel has absolutely the BEST location on Waikiki.				
3200335	50003915	See on maps that the hotel is on the west end of Waikiki Bay with wide sandy beach with best viewing angle of diamond head.				
3200335	50003916	Any hotel to the west has little to no beach.				
3200335	50003917	It is also far enough off the main boulevard to be quiet and have a huge yard and entrance.				
3200335	50003918	Next, the grand old architecture with tall ceilings gives and airy old-world Gatsby feel.				
3200335	50003919	They don't build like this anymore.				
3200335	50003920	After 2009 remodel, most rooms are luxurious, large and high quality.				
3200335	50003921	Restaurant food is very good.				
3200335	50003922	Potential drawbacks: The pool is small which was fine for me.				
3200335	50003923	This fact and others means this place is not geared towards children which is also a plus for me.				
3200335	50003924	There are more Disney-like places to stay if you have small kids.				
3200335	50003925	Restaurant food is pricey, but Waikiki is not a place for bargains.				
3200335	50003926	Most bathrooms have been nicely updated, but some still have not been upgraded.				
3200335	50003927	The Moana Surfrider is two doors down and also has grand old charm.				
3200335	50003928	For me, the Royal Hawaiian tops this due to the more secluded feel and quiet atmosphere.				
3200335	50003929	The Surfrider is directly on the main boulevard and feels noisy and hectic.				
3200335	50003930	"If you want to stay ""On the beach"" in Waikiki there are only and handful of choices and the Royal Hawaiian is the classiest, quiet and most Hawaiian feeling alternative."				
3200335	50003931	Other places claim to be on the beach, but there are across a very busy and touristy street.				
3200335	50003932	If you've got young kids maybe you should go somewhere else.				
3200335	50003933	If you're a couple or someone wanting to relax and chill in a beautiful surrounding, stay at the Royal Hawaiian.				

3180604	50003940	Nice place to stay in Cambridge ---SEP---		80004076	Dear PedroMCC, Thank you for taking the time to post your review on tripadvisor.com following your recent visit to the Hilton Cambridge City Centre.	
3180604	50003941	The Hilton Cambridge city centre Hotel is very well located, close to many tourist points of interest, restaurants and pubs.		80004077	I was delighted to note that you enjoyed your stay at the hotel, and in particular our Book Room restaurant.	
3180604	50003942	The service is very good and the staff very helpful and polite.		80004078	Please be assured that I have passed your very kind comments to all staff concerned.	
3180604	50003943	The only down side is the car park, the location is not very well indicated, the entrance is too narrow and it is very expensive.		80004079	With thanks once again	
3180604				80004080	and I look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back to the Hilton Cambridge City Centre in the very near future.

3182057	50003952	We have been been to Honolulu many times and decided to stay at the Ala Moana Hotel this time because of it's proximity to the Ala Moana Mall.		80004094	Next time when you visit, cap off that day at the beach, or exploring or shopping with a glass of wine or a beer and pupus from the Evening's Program available at our lobby Starbucks.

3182057	50003955	We started our days at the Plantation Cafe, it's a nice place to start your day off with a buffet full of scrambled egg chef style, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, fried rice, pastries, juices, coffee, fresh fruits including plenty of fresh papayas.				
3182057	50003956	We enjoyed all the shopping and restaurants next to the hotel.				
3182057	50003957	Also, the pool is a nice place to relax after a long day.				
3182057	50003958	We will be staying at the Ala Moana Hotel on our next trip to Honolulu !!

3282006	50004033	Close to most things in Melbourne not a far walk to crown.		80004206	However, I have noted your comment on valet parking and we deeply regret the disappointment caused.

3292384	50004040	My lack of sleep at the Premier Inn Cardiff ---SEP--- I needed to come home to sleep - the beds were rock hard as were the pillows.		80004221	Thank you for your review.	
3292384	50004041	My children commented the floor may be softer to sleep on.		80004222	It really matters to us that our guests have a comfortable nights sleep, and I am sorry that on this occasion we failed to provide this.	
3292384	50004042	Parking is a nightmare and the staff give out the wrong information - even after I had telephoned due to having extra luggage with a disabled child - we received a parking ticked.		80004223	Please be assured that at we take all feedback seriously and we would like the opportunity to investigate these issues further.	
3292384	50004043	Poor quality food		80004224	Please email your booking details including your reservation number to talktous@premierinn.com and we will follow this up with the Management Team.	
3292384	50004044	and they only had one portion of ribs in the whole restaurant at 6.30pm.		80004225	Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.	
3292384	50004045	The staff had no knowledge of the surrounding area and directions.				
3292384	50004046	It was a battle to have the right number of towels daily and I had to keep visiting reception rather than them bringing them up.				
3292384	50004047	If you like beds like concrete stay here!

3288051	50004065	The reception is a counter in the corridor and only really has room for two checking in at once.				
3288051	50004066	It feels crowded and noisy as you come in.				
3288051	50004067	The staff is very helpful and friendly and seemed to cope with evening rush as we checked in very efficiently.				
3288051	50004068	There is an Indochinese - thai food restaurant on-site but it is about a drive to get back to the main town where there are many more choices.				
3288051	50004069	We were just passing through and most of the other places were fully booked.				
3288051	50004070	Personally I will choose a spot closer to the main street another time.				

3315457	50004080	Hotel review ---SEP--- Staying at the Shannon Airport Hotel, Park Inn by Radisson was a great start to our holiday, good quality & value for money with friendly staff and a quick check in and check out.		80004267	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post a review of our hotel.	
3315457	50004081	Would definitely recommend it.		80004268	I was delighted to read that you had an enjoyable stay with us	
3315457				80004269	and I hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming you back again in the future.	
3315457				80004270	Kind regards, Louise O'Hara General Manager	

3295068	50004090	Enjoyed our stay!		80004281	Dear Guest, We are so glad that you chose to stay at our hotel - it was a pleasure to be your hosts while in Denver.	
3295068	50004091	Your staff could improve their customer service skills!		80004282	Thank you for the great suggestion on the water bottles!	
3295068	50004092	---SEP---		80004283	We also appreciate the feedback on our team of associates.	
3295068	50004093	Overall, we really enjoyed our stay (4 nights).		80004284	While all of our front desk agents do have English as their first language, some of our other associates do not - kindness and customer service are therefore are always important to ensure the each guest has a positive experience!	
3295068	50004094	Your location is great and our room was nice and clean.		80004285	Please come visit us again, it would be our pleasure to be your Denver home-away-from-home another time!	
3295068	50004095	For our purposes it did meet our needs!		80004286	Kind regards, The TownePlace Suites Denver Southeast Team	
3295068	50004096	However, I believe your staff at the front desk could improve their customer service skills, specially when it is clear that English is not one's first language.				
3295068	50004097	"Sometimes you don't feel ""welcome"" to go and request anything because they can be kind of harsh in their responses."				
3295068	50004098	Now, the fact that you only provide bottles of water for the first night was a bit disappointing.				
3295068	50004099	Some of us are not used to drinking water from the tap and, on the second night, when I requested for a bottle of water to the guy at the front desk (at night), he gave me ONE a bit hesitant.				
3295068	50004100	Then, on the third night he told my wife that bottles of water were for sale if we wanted more.				
3295068	50004101	"Certainly not very friendly and the feeling of ""having to beg for a bottle of water"" was not very nice."				
3295068	50004102	The bottom line is that apart from that tiny detail, our stay at the hotel was ok.				
3295068	50004103	It did comply with our needs for our 4 night stay and if you're planning on spending your days outdoors and using the hotel only for sleeping and maybe preparing yourself a nice breakfast the next day, then this is a very good option which we would totally recommend.				

3249144	50004110	Excellent apartment and very helpful management ---SEP--- Stayed at Premier apartments for 3 nights in November, travelling alone.		80004297	Dear Guest Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and thanks for such a great review.

3249144	50004112	I would definitely stay again.		80004299	Its great to read that you found Premier Apartments were ideal for your needs and we hope that we can look forward to welcoming you back in the very near future.

3304846	50004133	I accidentally left my mobile hot spot in the room and their housekeeper Sheila tracked me down before I left the hotel to return it.		80004327	We hope to become your hotel of choice for any future travel to Savannah.	
3304846				80004328	Thank you!	

3288931	50004140	Gavin ---SEP--- Great place to stay, my third holiday there.		80004339	Dear Gavin Thank you very much for your wonderful review on your recent stay with us, we really appreciate your kind comments, especially regarding our staff who enjoy making our guests feel relaxed & comfortable during their stay with us.

3288931	50004142	Just surprised by the amount of families with young kids this time around.		80004341	Best regards Kerstin & team	
3288931	50004143	The staff are great and nothing is too much trouble for them and their presentation is in line with the high standard of the resort.				
3288931	50004144	Anyone looking for a great place to chill out, this is it.				

3214846	50004150	Shocking level of disrepair and dirtiness ---SEP---		80004352	Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback following your stay.	
3214846	50004151	Photos speak for themselves.		80004353	Could you possibly contact me at alison.taborda@millenniumhotels.co.uk as I want to investigate these issues and establish which room you stayed in.	
3214846	50004152	Freezing room, external windows jammed open and inadequate secondary glazing.		80004354	Best regards, Alison	
3214846	50004153	Water not hot enough for bath.				
3214846	50004154	Cracked toilet bowl.				
3214846	50004155	Filthy rusty showerhead.				
3214846	50004156	Totally rusty radiator.				
3214846	50004157	Thick fluffy dust on skurting boards.				
3214846	50004158	Filthy drinks station.				
3214846	50004159	Dirty carpet that turned my socks black.				
3214846	50004160	Avoid at all costs - only thing it has going for it is location.				
3214846	50004161	If I could have got on a train straight home, I would have.				

3245032	50004170	Excellent! ---SEP---		80004365	Dear Kaitlin; From the arrival of your parents to your brother and your reaching out to me to arrange some special attention for 'mom and dad' we have to admit we had as much pride in being a small part of the treats as we could want!	
3245032	50004171	My brother and I surprised my parents with a weekend away and could not be happier.		80004366	"Thank you for the introduction to your very special parents - we found ourselves two more ""huggers"" as your dad said!!!"	
3245032	50004172	They had a great time and the staff was amazing!		80004367	Have a great summer and we hope you have some time with us of your own in the future, with us!	
3245032	50004173	They made sure my parents had a great anniversary weekend and we would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone!		80004368	Steve and the IATH Team of caring folks	
3245032	50004174	Thank you!				

3218217	50004180	Fantastic experience, ---SEP---		80004379	Thank you for reviewing the Bournemouth East Premier Inn on TripAdvisor and for your most favourable comments.	
3218217	50004181	We booked here for Christmas Eve and we were not disappointed.		80004380	I‚Äôm so happy that we were able to make you stay during Christmas a pleasant one.	
3218217	50004182	The room (10) was huge with plenty of space.		80004381	I will be sure to share you comments with Stacey and the rest of the Team.	
3218217	50004183	The staff were brilliant, they fetched us some extra mugs so that we could have coffee with some of our family who live nearby.		80004382	On behalf of all of us at Premier Inn, I would like to wish you and your family a very Happy New Year.	
3218217	50004184	The guy on the night shift was brilliant, helping me arrange the removal of the carrots that my grandchildren left out for Rudolph and I am sure I provided him with a laugh as I snuck out of the hotel with two empty stockings and returned with them full lol.		80004383	Best regards,	
3218217	50004185	Breakfast was great and everything we have come to expect from Premier Inn.				
3218217	50004186	Special mention to Stacey who was really great with my two excited grandchildren.				
3218217	50004187	Will definitely stay here again.				

3172060	50004190	On the Clyde ---SEP---		80004394	Dear AndyDon2012, Thanks for reviewing your visit and having stayed 5 nights, I'm delighted to read that all went well.	
3172060	50004191	This hotel is nicely appointed and while at first I was a bit disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt right downtown, we did find that it was only about a 7 pound cab ride to central station, (which for us Canadians who really didn‚Äôt have a clue where we were) was more or less in the heart of the city.		80004395	There has been particular focus within our Food & beverage team to review and improve the standards of quality and service and it's great to see this is being recognised by our guests.	
3172060	50004192	This hotel has a wonderful breakfast and we did have dinner here one evening and the food is good.		80004396	Your recommendation is really appreciated and I trust you will use Crowne Plaza Hotels again in the future.	
3172060	50004193	My husband took advantage of the gym amenities and found the staff there to be wonderful.		80004397	Kind regards Jason Dombrower General Manager	
3172060	50004194	I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.				
3172060	50004195	We were there for 5 nights... a wonderful stay.

3193980	50004210	College Family Weekend Getaway ---SEP---		80004421	Dear Tracy M., We thank you for the 5 star rating and appreciate you being our guest.	
3193980	50004211	We wanted something close to the airport and my daughter's college campus.		80004422	I hope you and your daughter enjoyed your time together while in Tampa.	
3193980	50004212	Hilton Garden Inn provided ease of transportation for our scheduled events.		80004423	Our Starbucks coffee bar is open between 6 am to 11 pm each and every day.	
3193980	50004213	The Garden Inn was well kept and maintained.		80004424	I am sorry that you were not given this information.	
3193980	50004214	if I had only one suggestion, it would be that the coffee bar in the lobby remained open longer in the morning.		80004425	I apologize for the inconvenience.	
3193980	50004215	We are not exactly early birds :)		80004426	I hope that you will visit us again the next time you are in our area!

3197877	50004220	Fab Hotel ---SEP---		80004438	Dear Guest, Thank you so much for taking the time to provide us with such a wonderful review of your recent stay with us.	
3197877	50004221	Our stay at the Galway Bay hotel was amazing the staff are so kind and helpful and we got upgraded to a sea view room for our anniversary, the spa treatments are so relaxing and the food is amazing too will definitely be back!		80004439	It's always a pleasure to hear such positive reviews from our guests.

3232551	50004234	Makes it feel like the comfort of home away from home.				

3316972	50004240	It's like a cheap resort ---SEP---		80004466	Hi Ma'ayan C, Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review, we appreciate your feedback.	
3316972	50004241	I was really disappointed by the kitchen, it didn't have anything at all, considering it's a hostel and not a caravan park a lot of people show up with nothing to cook with.		80004467	I apologize that you didnt have cutlery to use in the kitchen, however upon check in the receptionist would ave advised you we dont store our cutlery in the kitchen as it tends to disappear very quickly.	
3316972	50004242	Check in would have taken forever, I did have to make my own bed or otherwise move my stuff to a different room, after 6-7 hours on a bus when you know the bed is supposed to be made, is kind of frustrating...		80004468	Like most hostel we give our guests a set of cutlery for just a $5 deposit which is returned upon check out.	
3316972	50004243	Other than that, amazing!		80004469	This ensures our cutlery and dishes are all returned to us once guests are finished with them.	
3316972				80004470	Im sorry this may have been miscommunicated to you.	
3316972				80004471	Im glad your experience was great though	
3316972				80004472	and you enjoyed all the other things about our hostel.	
3316972				80004473	Look forward to seeing you again next time, Until then safe and happy travels!	

3304819	50004250	$75M refurb - Don't stay here at all costs!!!!		80004484	Dear Dipak P, We are sincerely sorry to learn of your disappointment regarding your recent experience at the Chateau.	
3304819	50004251	---SEP---		80004485	We truly value your feedback and would like to better understand your disappointment if you can contact me at genevieve.parent@fairmont.com so I can follow-up directly with you.	
3304819	50004252	Trades on its historical site however service is rubbish, there is no such thing as customer service here.		80004486	Sincerely, Genevieve Parent PR Director	
3304819	50004253	They don't have a clue about personal touch.				
3304819	50004254	Refurb what refurb!!!!				
3304819	50004255	They spent $75m on what exactly.				
3304819	50004256	Rooms are cramped, with a pungent odour and bathrooms are dinghy.				
3304819	50004257	The gym closes early not like other much better hotels e.g. Ritz Carlton or Shangri la which have 24 hour access.				
3304819	50004258	If you want a hotel that's as busy as Piccadilly Circus or Times Square then this one is for you !!!!				

3225335	50004260	Ivan and O'shey - you rescued me!		80004497	Dear Sue, We are so happy that Ivan and O'shey were able to help direct you over to our hotel.	
3225335	50004261	---SEP---		80004498	It is also fantastic to hear that you enjoyed our comfortable accommodations and on-site amenities.	
3225335	50004262	"I arrived in Orlando alone and exhausted, drove myself to the wrong place with ""Point"" in its name, and ended up in a big dark parking garage."		80004499	We appreciate you sharing your excellent experience with the TripAdvisor Community.	
3225335	50004263	When I called the front desk for help, everything got better.		80004500	We cannot wait to welcome you back with us again soon!	
3225335	50004264	Ivan and O'shey very kindly directed me to the correct facility, and with the help of Wilfredo, got me settled into a wonderful comfortable room.				
3225335	50004265	I've been here a few days now, and every single staff I've encountered has been a pleasure.				
3225335	50004266	They genuinely love their jobs and enjoy interacting with customers.				
3225335	50004267	In many ways a hotel is hotel, and a pool is a pool, but in my experience its the people who make a difference.				
3225335	50004268	Five stars to the Peeps at the Point.				
3225335	50004269	*****				

3201458	50004270	Awful Experience ---SEP---		80004511	I am truly sorry to read this and will be investigating as a matter of urgency.	
3201458	50004271	Took my mother to restaurant and can guarantee will not be back to this establishment and will not be recommending it to anyone!		80004512	No guest should experience this, and we absolutely cater for all dietary requirements.	
3201458	50004272	Server was very stressed and first communication from her was basically take a seat you are putting me out by coming in which is not what my expectations were of such an establishment.		80004513	I hope that you will view this experience as teething problems and give us another chance to prove ourselves.	
3201458	50004273	I then asked for details on Gluten Free food and she gave my mother a look rolling her eyes and i thought was almost going to say to her could you not just eat normal food.		80004514	Yours sincerely, Adrian McNally General Manager	
3201458	50004274	We then got the wrong food and think it may have been for a table close by as a couple had been asking on their food				
3201458	50004275	and then they got up and seemed to walk out.				
3201458	50004276	Even paying for the bill i could hear the angry young lady use obsence language at the till as it would not seem to work.				
3201458	50004277	Definitley thought i would have an out of the world experience				
3201458	50004278	but it was far from that.				
3201458	50004279	Not sure if the staff were stressed or if they clearly didn't wish to be working at all?				
3201458	50004280	i really hope that the hotel's service improves as wouldn't like for such a new venture to give everyone bad impressions.				

3286187	50004290	This was our first visit; but definitely wont be our last!		80004525	Dear guest, thank you for your kind review ad for taking the time to share your comments online.

3286187	50004294	Our room was on the 2nd floor (facing pool and hot tub).				
3286187	50004295	It was a great location that included complimentary breakfast buffet, and free shuttle service to Mont-Tremblant Village.				
3286187	50004296	The Staff was very helpful in giving us directions to favourite local hang outs and restaurants...				
3286187	50004297	we will most definitely come back again.				

3230604	50004300	turned away late at night even though i was 100% booked in ---SEP---		80004539	Dear colcorky Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Village Newcastle.	
3230604	50004301	i will never ever stay at one of these hotels again , my company booked me in this hotel for 1 night ( 02/05/2018 ) with a meal in the restaurant and breakfast all in one package ,, arrives at 21-30 after travelling for 4 hours to be told that they operate on a : overbooking of 5 rooms in case people don't turn up : basis ,,, so on arrival me and my friend were told everyone has turned up and you are one of the last to turn up		80004540	Please accept my apologies for the issues you have encountered please contact our front of house manager to discuss your comments Vicky.simpson@village-hotels.com Regards	
3230604	50004302	so we have no room for you and was sent packing at 22-00 , we ended up having to get a taxi to a hotel in Gosforth park which was then to late to get any food ,,,,,,, disgusting way to run a hotel.				

3264344	50004310	Friendly Staff/Great Value ---SEP--- I have stayed at this Red Roof Inn numerous times.		80004551	Dear Paul, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about our Hotel.	
3264344	50004311	Yes, one could quibble about the linens, the bedding, and a few other amenities, but overall I do not think you could find a better deal.		80004552	I agree we have a great staff.	
3264344	50004312	It is not for you if want first class accommodations.		80004553	Next time you come I hope we have the new Pavement done around the Pool.	
3264344	50004313	If, however you want a decent place with friendly staff and a great price, I highly recommend the Red Roof Inn at Brandon/Tampa.		80004554	Hope to see you soon Paul.

3315953	50004325	Would love there to be a massage therapy service offered but enjoyed the do it yourself spa all the same!		80004571	Kind regards, Clare McGreevy Guest Relations Manager

3178733	50004330	Very good value ---SEP---		80004582	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write such a positive review of the Brighton Hotel.	
3178733	50004331	I stayed at the Brighton Hotel for 4 nights b&b.		80004583	It was especially nice to have such kind comment about the staff.	
3178733	50004332	The place is run down, but having recently been taken on by new owners, you can already see they are working to renovate it.		80004584	I do hope that the next time you visit Brighton you choose to stay with us again.	
3178733	50004333	Hopefully they will keep the many original features.		80004585	If you do so please contact the hotel directly and you will benefit from a returning guest discount.	
3178733	50004334	The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable about local events, eateries eto and bent over backwards to help.		80004586	Regards Matthew Bennett	
3178733	50004335	Food was basic but hot and enjoyable.				
3178733	50004336	Room very clean and a good comfortable size for a solo traveller.				
3178733	50004337	I would definitely stay there again, for the price it was a bargain!				
3178733	50004338	Lets hope they don't raise it too much once it's all done up!				

3297184	50004340	Excellent value and location ---SEP---		80004597	Dear Brian_P_in_KC, Thanks for staying with us during your most recent trip to Branson and staying at our sister property the Spinning Wheel Inn during other visits as well.	
3297184	50004341	We found the Twelve Oaks to be perfect for our needs.		80004598	We are always happy to hear that our repeat customers continuously enjoy their stays :)	
3297184	50004342	There is so much to do in Branson that all we ask of a hotel is a clean bed and shower.		80004599	We appreciate that you took the time to write us such a wonderful review.	
3297184	50004343	Twelve Oaks provided that and then some.		80004600	Thanks again	
3297184	50004344	The grounds and the rooms are spotless.		80004601	and we look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3297184	50004345	The staff from the front desk to the breakfast room to the grounds and housekeepers were all so friendly and polite; they definitely made us feel at home.		80004602	Sincerely, Jennifer Moore Twelve Oaks Inn	
3297184	50004346	Breakfast was tasty, with plenty of variety.				
3297184	50004347	"The location on the west end of ""the Strip"" is perfect."				
3297184	50004348	The theme park is a short drive away.				
3297184	50004349	And even better is the hotel's convenient access to Branson's lifesaving color routes that let visitor's avoid the congestion on 76 highway.				
3297184	50004350	We have also stayed at the sister property Spinning Wheel Inn next door.				
3297184	50004351	You can't go wrong with either.				

3219541	50004360	Lovely hotel, nice staff, shame about the noise!		80004613	Dear Emily H, Thank you for your feedback and for choosing One King West.	
3219541	50004361	---SEP---		80004614	I am pleased to hear that our modern home-inspired suites were instrumental in making your stay an enjoyable one.	
3219541	50004362	The hotel was great, we loved the room and the style.		80004615	I am disappointed to hear about the issues you experienced in regards to the AC unit as we strive to provide our guests with the highest level of service in all aspects.	
3219541	50004363	However we had a very loud air conditioning unit outside our apartment that hindered sleeping.		80004616	I understand this would have been an inconvenience and apologize.	
3219541	50004364	On our complaint at 2am we were offered an alternative room, but since past that night we only had one remaining we declined to move.		80004617	I have communicated this to the concerned staff and assure you this will not occur again in the future.	
3219541	50004365	No visible effort was made to fix the unit and it remained loud for our final night.		80004618	Again, thank you for your review and I look forward to welcoming you back in the future.	
3219541	50004366	On arrival our bath was dirty, however management fixed this quickly and with sincere apologies.		80004619	Regards, Steve O'Brien General Manager	
3219541	50004367	Honestly the stay was great, the hotel fantastic.				
3219541	50004368	But even with a very nice bed it was difficult to sleep with the noise.				
3219541	50004369	Hence the loss of a star.				

3324230	50004370	Best nights sleep EVER!		80004620	Dear Brridgette98, Thank you for your kind comments and compliments.	
3324230	50004371	---SEP--- Arrived quite late in the evening but was greeted with a very warm welcome.		80004621	I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay at Leeds City West Premier Inn and look forward to welcoming you back again soon.	
3324230	50004372	Was quickly and efficiently checked in and directed to our room.		80004622	Kind Regard, Beth ‚Äì Host & all the team at Leeds City West	
3324230	50004373	I'm always impressed with the room size you tend to get with Premier Inn and our stay this time did not disappoint.				
3324230	50004374	Clean and tidy room - appreciated the air con given the temperature in England at the moment.				
3324230	50004375	Breakfast the following morning was fine, nice range of options.				
3324230	50004376	But the real star of the stay was the bed.				
3324230	50004377	The Hypnos mattress was such a welcome break for someone suffering with insomnia.				
3324230	50004378	"""A good nights sleep, guaranteed"" is definitely a promise kept by Premier Inn."				
3324230	50004379	And then to find out you can order the same mattress from Premier Inns website - what a win!				

3219067	50004380	Great place to stay ---SEP---		80004633	Hello S L, Thank you for your comments.	
3219067	50004381	The Coast is situated in a good location that is within walking distance of shopping and lots of restaraunts.		80004634	I am happy to hear our staff was accommodating, and our amenities and location were of benefit to you during your stay.	
3219067	50004382	The eateries within the hotel are good as well.		80004635	We look forward to your next stay with us.	
3219067	50004383	Rooms are currently being updated which was definitely time.		80004636	Best Regards, Doug Andrews General Manager	
3219067	50004384	The staff are very accomodating and helpful.				
3219067	50004385	Always willing to assist.				

3274868	50004390	Amazing service to a stranded family ---SEP---		80004647	Yikes Vicky H....	
3274868	50004391	After finding out that our car needed a new engine on our vacation from Ontario we (my husband and 2 kids) needed to extend our trip to an extra week.		80004648	sorry about your wheels but we loved having you.	
3274868	50004392	The hotel staff was nothing but accommodating to us.		80004649	Thank you for the very kind comments and great shout out to Craig.	
3274868	50004393	They extended our stay at a very reasonable rate.		80004650	I have to admit Vicky H I am totally impressed that you found such positives in a vacation that many people would have probably coined a DISASTER!	
3274868	50004394	It was our daughter's birthday while we were there, the hotel sent her 2 dessert plates which she loved.		80004651	You are probably a pretty cool person Vicky H....	
3274868	50004395	All staff (especially Craig) met all our requests to make our stay comfortable during a stressful time.		80004652	thank you for sharing your experience with the TA world.	
3274868	50004396	We even had a personal car offered to us from their staff!!				
3274868	50004397	When we left the hotel they offered our kids a treat.				
3274868	50004398	The room was always clean, the pool was amazing, location was great to walk everywhere or to take the bus.				
3274868	50004399	We want to send a huge thanks to all the staff at the hotel for making our stay great.				
3274868	50004400	Thanks!!				

3290231	50004410	Perfect hotel in Honolulu ---SEP--- Absolutely gorgeous hotel, five minutes walk from Waikiki beach.		80004663	Aloha Paco A, Mahalo for your kind words about our hotel and your appreciation of our mid-century modern decor.	
3290231	50004411	Rooms are huge and clean (loved the cool wooden walls in the shower!), the bar has a great service and very good cocktails.		80004664	It brings me great joy that you enjoyed even the smallest touches, as we put a lot of effort and thought into our look.	
3290231	50004412	Special mention for the reception guys, always helpful, and for Meena who helped us organising our excursions in the best possibile way.		80004665	We hold ourselves to a high standard of customer service, so it is pleasing that our team, and specifically Meena, was accommodating and friendly.	
3290231				80004666	It is also nice to hear you were impressed with our on-site restaurant, Hideout.	
3290231				80004667	We are delighted that you enjoyed your visit to The Laylow, and hope to welcome you back in the future!	
3290231				80004668	Mahalo nui loa, Robert C. Friedl General Manager	

3289817	50004420	Disappointed ---SEP---		80004679	Dear Sue C Thank you for taking the time to review your stay on Tripadvisor.	
3289817	50004421	Great location, very average customer service.		80004680	I was disappointed to read that you did not enjoy your time with us	
3289817	50004422	Rooms are a long way from where you park your car so be prepared for a walk.		80004681	and I sincerely apologise for these shortcomings.	
3289817	50004423	We found it hard to even get a car park!		80004682	I will certainly discuss your concerns regarding the Restaurant with my team and take action to improve.	
3289817	50004424	The onsite restaurant was very disappointing, overpriced for very average food, service was slow and the food was just warm.		80004683	In regards to the power outage on the Sunday evening, this was very unexpected for us and was a complete Western Power blackout of the area, right up to Busselton.	
3289817	50004425	We also had a blackout while we were there and it was chaos.		80004684	We did the best we could in the circumstances and obviously with the timing of the power cut it was right on dinner service	
3289817	50004426	The lighting outside our room on the walkway was terrible a real hazard, so when the power went out we had to use our phones to get to reception to get some candles.		80004685	so it did become very busy.	
3289817	50004427	All in all very disappointing and won't be going back, they really need to lift their game when charging the rates they do!		80004686	I apologise for the inconvenience caused.	
3289817				80004687	Sue, I thank you again for your feedback and hope that we have the opportunity to see you again.	
3289817				80004688	Warm Regards Bronwyn Bulpitt General Manager	

3273072	50004430	Coconut waikiki ---SEP---		80004699	Aloha!

3273072				80004701	We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay with us and it sounds like you were a big fan of our complimentary continental breakfast.

3315531	50004440	Fabulous Service, Great Prices.		80004714	Good Evening Former Guest, Governor Macquarie Motor Inn is now Littomore Bathurst.	
3315531	50004441	Will definitely stay again ---SEP---		80004715	After renovations across the entire property, we are confident in our facilities.	
3315531	50004442	After choosing this Motor Inn from a plethora of choices, the staff wen t above and beyond to ensure that my stay with them was superb.		80004716	Contact us on 02 6331 2211 to book now !

3315531	50004445	When next in Bathurst, we will stay again!!!				

3237569	50004450	Almost Paradise ---SEP---		80004728	Aloha Eric, Thank you for your recent stay with us on the North Shore of Oahu.	
3237569	50004451	We wanted something off the beaten path but had all the modern amenities so chose the Courtyard on the north shore.		80004729	We appreciate the time you have taken to leave some feedback on your stay with us.	
3237569	50004452	We were provided a room facing the ocean and the view is absolutely fantastic.		80004730	We are so grateful that you enjoyed your time with us and hope you visit us again!	
3237569	50004453	The staff is very friendly and professional, rooms are clean and the pool area is exceptional.		80004731	Mahalo	
3237569	50004454	We really enjoyed the access to the polynesan center as well.				
3237569	50004455	The bed is a bit lumpy and soft for us and the road noise is actually much louder than what I would consider okay.				
3237569	50004456	If we were surfers, access to the beaches would have been a bonus as well, but any stretch of beach works for us...which is right across the street.				
3237569	50004457	There are a few drawbacks, but the view and staff make up for a lot.				

3314178	50004460	Please expedite the renovations!		80004742	Dear JPKook1, Thank you for comments.	
3314178	50004461	The lobby is fine, but...		80004743	We are doing the renovations as fast as we can.	
3314178	50004462	---SEP--- Please expedite the renovations!		80004744	Please come back over when we're finished and enjoy the finished product.	
3314178	50004463	The lobby is fine, but the upper floors are, to say the least, a bit dowdy and frightening in fact.		80004745	Robert D, Guest Relations Manager	

3247778	50004470	GH review ---SEP---		80004756	Dear hongg96, thank you for sharing your comments regarding your experience at our Hampton Inn & Suites.	
3247778	50004471	I hope the hotel can be miore responsible in the future in taking care of the mistakes in charging guest's credit card.		80004757	If your billing issue has not been resolved to your 100% satisfaction please contact me and I will work with you for a quick resolution.	
3247778	50004472	I think that it is always the most important issue for the guests not losing money unreasonablely.		80004758	Thank you for choosing our hotel and we hope to see you on your future trips to Denver.

3273425	50004485	Parking in front meant easy access with luggage.				
3273425	50004486	The cottage was nicely decorated and clean.				
3273425	50004487	Staff was very helpful with suggestions for walks to take and where to eat.				
3273425	50004488	A lovely young woman brought late afternoon warm homemade scones, butter and jam through the torrential rain- a nice touch.

3171055	50004491	We had a room at the rear of the hotel on ground level and was not mad about it.		80004783	I am delighted to note you enjoyed your stay with us at Slieve Russell, and look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back soon.

3318708	50004503	Bathroom was clean enough but could do with updating.				
3318708	50004504	The hotel is in a good location , a short walk to Chinatown and overlooking a park.				
3318708	50004505	The hotel is much larger than it appears at first sight.				
3318708	50004506	We stayed one night prior to a tour				
3318708	50004507	and we were happy with our choice.				

3190814	50004510	Check this out!		80004808	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for your kind words, I was delighted to read your comments regarding fab staff and great rooms with a good layout.

3171477	50004542	Recently enjoyed a one night stay (wish it could have been longer) at Buckland Retreat.		80004855	However, one night is definitely not enough to fully explore the beautiful Alpine Valleys and truly relax.in our beautiful environment.	
3171477	50004543	Loved the views, fireplace, double shower in the bathroom and huge bed.		80004856	So hopefully we get to have you stay again and for a few more days!	
3171477	50004544	Studio is well appointed with all necessary requirements including coffee machine, dishwasher, cook top etc.		80004857	Cheers, Sabine & Eddie	
3171477	50004545	Great base for exploring the area.				

3272116	50004550	They experiance was a pleasure ---SEP---		80004868	Thank you for taking the time to write a review on TripAdvisor and I am thrilled to read that you enjoyed your stay.	
3272116	50004551	From start to finish including meals etc was very good.		80004869	I have passed on your kind comments to the team who were thrilled to receive such feedback.	
3272116	50004552	It was a pleasure to stay at a freindly hotel that takes time to look after their visitors.		80004870	I hope that I have the opportunity to welcome you back to Leeds in the future Kind Regards James	
3272116	50004553	The room was clean tidy and well presented.				
3272116	50004554	However I found it difficult to use the coffee machine.				
3272116	50004555	Could be useful to have a kettle in the room as well.				

3255990	50004560	In front of the beach ---SEP---		80004881	Dear Fayesim Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us.	
3255990	50004561	The hotel is just in front of the beach, so I paid A$20 extra to upgrade to a ocean view room, so I could see beautiful sunrise in the morning!		80004882	It is great to read that you enjoyed the Hotel's central location and our facilities and the spectacular view from the Ocean view rooms.	
3255990	50004562	The room is spacious too!		80004883	I will share your positive feedback with the Novotel team.	
3255990	50004563	Guest can also take the free bus to the city to shop around or for dinner.		80004884	We hope to see you on a future visit.	
3255990	50004564	The bus stop is in front of the hotel.		80004885	Kind Regards Guest Relations Manager	
3255990	50004565	There is a convenience store opposite the hotel, so I could top up my prepaid optus card there easily.				

3257944	50004570	Classic Hotel ---SEP---		80004896	Dear bucks17, It was a pleasure reading your review and I am so glad to know that you had a thoroughly enjoyable overall stay with us.	
3257944	50004571	This is a gorgeous old Sydney hotel that has been kept up well.		80004897	I especially like that you found our breakfast buffet to be of a high standard.	
3257944	50004572	The foyer is beautiful and makes a grand impression on entrance.		80004898	Thank you for your feedback	
3257944	50004573	The rooms were extremely well appointed.		80004899	and I hope you have the opportunity to stay a little longer on you next visit...	
3257944	50004574	I only wish I‚Äôd had more than one night there!		80004900	Andrew Allen Hotel Manager	
3257944	50004575	Hotel breakfast is fantastic				

3232117	50004580	Located in the heart of the action ---SEP---		80004911	Dear Yankee-on-walk-about, Thank you for writing a review.	
3232117	50004581	The Inn on Fifth is located right in the heart of Naples next to many restaurants and is only a few blocks walk to the great beach.		80004912	I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your accommodations and our wonderful location to all the shops and restaurants on Fifth Avenue.	
3232117	50004582	The rooms are very nice with great linens etc.		80004913	We hope you will come and visit with us again.	
3232117	50004583	The reason for my mediocre rating is the value.				
3232117	50004584	This hotel is very expensive so my expectations were very high.				
3232117	50004585	I was a little disappointed considering the price.				

3168165	50004590	Comfortable but..		80004924	Hello Lisa F, Just messaging you back to say thank you for your time spent reviewing our Hotel and a special thank you for your kind scoring you gave while filling out the review.	
3168165	50004591	---SEP---		80004925	I know that there is always room for improvement and with this great feedback we will always grow and learn to get things better.	
3168165	50004592	We stayed at the Clayton for two nights.		80004926	Hopefully on your next visit to us we can try and make your experience a 5-star one, our property is one of several in the Dublin location with the Clayton group and we would also highly recommend our sister hotels if any guests are looking for a specific stay in our fair city.	
3168165	50004593	The room was very clean and had everything you would expect from a hotel room.		80004927	We are very grateful for the scoring and feedback, thank you once again, Kindest Regards Daniel O' Connor Customer Service Manager	
3168165	50004594	The bed was large and exceptionally comfortable and we were very happy with the room.				
3168165	50004595	Unfortunately the hotel itself was soulless.				
3168165	50004596	We ate there the first night in the lobby as the restaurant does not open in the evenings.				
3168165	50004597	The menu is very small and very expensive.				
3168165	50004598	It was not the romantic meal you would expect for a couples weekend as the lobby is cold and there are people coming and going.				
3168165	50004599	The second night we ate in the bar and this was not much better.				
3168165	50004600	The bar is a large empty space filled with televisions.				
3168165	50004601	It was so cold				
3168165	50004602	I had to leave my jacket on.				
3168165	50004603	So we retreated to the comfort of our big comfy bed, and all was well again, that is untill we where rudely awakened at about 3.20am buy what I assume was fans from the air conditioning system in the hotel?				
3168165	50004604	The noise filled the room and the hallway.				
3168165	50004605	I rang front desk to ask if this was normal and they said no and that they would send someone to look into it but we heard nothing back and we eventually fell asleep again (even with the noise).				
3168165	50004606	All in all we enjoyed our weekend away				
3168165	50004607	but I don't think we would stay at the Clayton again.				
3168165	50004608	For anyone who is going to park over night you can expect to pay ‚Ç¨13 a night which came as a surprise to me seeing as we spent nearly ‚Ç¨200 a night room rate, I thought parking would be included in it.				

3170045	50004610	Excellent decision to stay here ---SEP---		80004938	Thank you for posting this lovely and very informative review for us.	
3170045	50004611	My mom and I stayed here for a week and I am hard pressed to think of anything negative to say.		80004939	We are so happy to hear you and your mom enjoyed your stay with us and the team looked after you.	
3170045	50004612	Comments below: *The staff were lovely.		80004940	We are looking forward to welcoming you back.	
3170045	50004613	Special shout-out to the doormen who acknowledged our comings and goings in a very welcoming - not creepy :) - way.		80004941	Once again, thank you, B.	
3170045	50004614	*The room was very nice albeit small with typical Conrad features i.e. turn down, nespresso, etc.				
3170045	50004615	Great shower.				
3170045	50004616	*Wonderful Executive Lounge.				
3170045	50004617	The evening happy hour could have sufficed as dinner.				
3170045	50004618	Lounge staff did a great job.				
3170045	50004619	Breakfast was good, however...				
3170045	50004620	*Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was AMAZING.				
3170045	50004621	Free for Diamonds but even if I paid for it, it would have been worth it...				
3170045	50004622	well, maybe for one morning anyway :)				
3170045	50004623	Buffet options are plentiful and you can also get cooked to order.				
3170045	50004624	Service is attentive unlike some hotel buffets.				
3170045	50004625	*I liked the location.				
3170045	50004626	I had been a bit worried that it would be a bit too remote at night but worries were unfounded.				
3170045	50004627	The tube is directly across the street.				
3170045	50004628	There are several local bars within a block or two and a 10-15 minute walk gives you a multitude of options.				
3170045	50004629	*The hotel bar is open late and they have reasonably priced whiskey.				
3170045	50004630	The only downside of our stay I would say was that the bar staff was a bit lame.				
3170045	50004631	Not terrible, just not very customer-service oriented.				
3170045	50004632	The three nights we were in the bar there were a handful of customer there (10-15) and the bartender hung out in back rather than standing behind the bar to watch over customers.				
3170045	50004633	Again, nothing egregious but not exactly a welcoming feeling.				

3178477	50004640	fantastic :)		80004952	Good Afternoon, Thank you for your review and I am delighted you enjoyed your visit to us here at Go Glasgow and you had the opportunity to experience our high level of quality and service first hand.	
3178477	50004641	---SEP--- cant fault this hotel, the rooms are stunning, well designed and large and clean, as is the bathroom.		80004953	I am so glad you enjoyed the accommodation, facilities, food service and hospitality.	
3178477	50004642	good tea and coffee facilities, very comfortable beds and good tv with all the channels.		80004954	Thank you for your lovely kind words regarding the hotel and the team, I will personally pass on your kind words to the whole team.	
3178477	50004643	we didn't have breakfast but ate in the restaurant on the evening.		80004955	It was a pleasure to have you and we look forward to seeing you very soon.	
3178477	50004644	although slightly pricey it was our victory meal for conquering Ben Nevis and the quality of the food was so good it was worth the money.		80004956	With best wishes	
3178477	50004645	would love to stay again :)		80004957	Graham Urquhart General Manager	

3184278	50004650	Disappointing lack of professionalism, helpfulness, proactivity ---SEP---		80004968	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.	
3184278	50004651	No help with a group booking , very rude telephone manner when trying to book, repeated calls from different members quoting online rates, hotel did not match/ offer any group package , then on check in scoffed that we would have got a much better rate if we had booked direct, when I clarified that actually we had called multiple times and was offered no help, they scoffed again and refused to help componsate in anyway.		80004969	We are sorry to hear that your experience was anything less than satisfying due the service you received and the availability of room at that time.	
3184278	50004652	Rooms were all split up and not ready, even though we repeatidly told them in advance we had dinner booked.		80004970	It is understandable where your frustration is coming from and it is of our best interest to make sure that you are well taken care of during your stay.	
3184278	50004653	Very frustrating		80004971	We strive for guest satisfaction and we apologize that your experience fell short of that standard.	
3184278				80004972	Your review is a big help for us to improve our service.	
3184278				80004973	We hope that you will reconsider and give us another chance to provide you an experience that is truly excellent in all aspects.	

3243158	50004660	Albany is a great destination ---SEP---		80004984	Dear Diane, Thank you for your feedback.	
3243158	50004661	The rooms were not adequately clean.		80004985	It is disappointing to hear that you have not enjoyed your stay at the IBIS Styles Albany.	
3243158	50004662	The linen was poor quality and threadbare.		80004986	If you would like to contact me to discuss further the issues you encountered during your stay.	
3243158	50004663	The rooms smelt musty and the food in the restaurant was barely edible.		80004987	Regards, Dylan Stickle General Manager	
3243158	50004664	All round very disappointing.				
3243158	50004665	Access to the rooms with heavy suitcases up a steep flight of stairs is dangerous.				

3310970	50004670	Excellent Value.		80004998	Dear GAJLF Thank you for your kind review, we are delighted that you left with such a positive impression and we are most grateful for your positive feedback.	
3310970	50004671	---SEP--- Value for money.		80004999	We do hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.	
3310970	50004672	Clean and spacious family room.		80005000	Warm regards Des	
3310970	50004673	Restaurant good, with very helpful and friendly staff both in the restaurant and the hotel.				
3310970	50004674	Downside - missing a place to have a drink in the evenings.				
3310970	50004675	Would stay again.				

3194103	50004680	Wet Wet Wet in Cardiff ---SEP--- Clean Rooms , Toilet and Shower bit on the small side but acceptable , Bed was Comfy, excellent value for Money , cheap car parking on site , great location for Cardiff City Center .		80005011	Thank you for taking your time to review your recent stay with.

3194103				80005013	Kind regards, Fabrice Ledentu	

3277572	50004690	great hotel except the bathroom ---SEP---		80005024	Dear Mr P‚Ä¶Grantley, Thank you for your advice on the bathroom.	
3277572	50004691	The hotel was very good.		80005025	We shall address today with new silicon replacing the old.	
3277572	50004692	The Cricketers Bar was excellant with very good service when they were busy.		80005026	Hoping to welcome you both back soon.	
3277572	50004693	Very surprised at the prices during the happy Hour.		80005027	Yours sincerely, David David G.A. Perry Chief Executive Officer	
3277572	50004694	Our only disappointment was that for a five star hotel we couldnt believe the amount of mould in the shower enclosure.				
3277572	50004695	The cleaning staff hadnt done a very good job.				
3277572	50004696	Room 439.				

3178598	50004700	Disappointing service ---SEP---		80005038	Hello aaragordon19, We apologize that your stay with us was not 110% perfect.	
3178598	50004701	Many problems with service on this stay.		80005039	We would love to make this right!	
3178598	50004702	Perhaps this was due to the 4th of July holiday, and the hotel being full of families at a sports tournament, but definitely not the service we would expect from Hilton.		80005040	If you would, please give us a call at 303.297.1300 and ask for our Front Desk Director, Lynzy.	
3178598				80005041	Thank you!	
3178598				80005042	-Karley, Sr. Marketing Manager	

3261909	50004710	Nice motel ---SEP--- Stayed here for 2 nights over the long weekend.		80005053	Thank you for taking the time to give us a review.	
3261909	50004711	Friendly staff, clean rooms and reasonably priced.		80005054	we look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3261909	50004712	Would stay again.				
3261909	50004713	Was also advised that with your key you get members discount and the RSL across the road.				

3192388	50004720	Bar food ---SEP---		80005065	Dear Guest, Thank you for your recent review and thank you for your valued feedback.	
3192388	50004721	Had bar food menu I ordered the beef burger To my surprise it arrived on a piece of wood with the chips in a small bucket(very small bucket).		80005066	I have passed on your comments to our executive chef and he also appreciates your comments.	
3192388	50004722	My first thought was that the kitchen ran out on plates, as I spotted other tables with plates.		80005067	We thank you for your custom and look forward to welcoming you back to see us in the not too distant future, Kind regards Ciaran O Donovan	
3192388	50004723	I felt like a animal				
3192388	50004724	Then I thought maybe this is novelty food				
3192388	50004725	Well it didn't work Have pride in your products and serve with the respect it deserves.				
3192388	50004726	The food taste was ok.				
3192388	50004727	although chips(in the bucket) portion smaller than McDonalds portion				

3221707	50004730	Just OK ---SEP---		80005078	I recently received a copy of your review of the Extended Stay America Fort Lauderdale - Convention Center - Marina.	
3221707	50004731	We stayed here for one night before leaving on a cruise because they offered a free shuttle from the hotel to the cruise port.		80005079	Our company prides itself on excellent guest service, so it was gratifying to read your feedback about our staff.	
3221707	50004732	The shuttle driver was very nice and that service was good and convenient.		80005080	I would like to give you my most heartfelt apology regarding the part of your stay that was not satisfactory.	
3221707	50004733	The hotel is very basic and somewhat run down.		80005081	Given how hard we work to provide our guests with outstanding accommodations, I was troubled to read your remarks about the bed in your suite.	
3221707	50004734	The beds were not comfortable and the elevator was so slow I wondered if it would ever move at times.		80005082	Please know how important your comfort is to us.	
3221707	50004735	The staff at the front desk were pleasant.		80005083	We have chosen bedding that we think best fits our customers' needs, and we continue to look for new ways to satisfy everyone's sleeping preferences.	
3221707	50004736	The shower was slow and the water was tepid at best, and there was no shampoo.		80005084	We will use your comments and continue to look at ways to improve our bedding in the future.	
3221707	50004737	I forgot to ask the front desk if they had any, and was in the shower, so I just used some that I had surprisingly remembered to pack.				
3221707	50004738	No major complaints but not sure I would stay here again.				
3221707	50004739	It was very close to eating and shopping and that was a plus.				

3189243	50004740	Raj is the best!!		80005095	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to sing our praises and pass along recognition to our reservations manager, Raj.	
3189243	50004741	---SEP---		80005096	We work hard to exceed expectations so it's always great when that is recognized.	
3189243	50004742	We have just returned from another wonderful trip to Watermark beach resort.		80005097	We are so pleased that you continue to choose Watermark as your home away from home and look forward to many more visits.	
3189243	50004743	We have been coming with our family since 2009 and have recommended the resort to many of our friends.		80005098	Janine Salmond Guest & Owner Relations Coordinator	
3189243	50004744	I just wanted to give a shout out to the reservations manager Raj who went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.				
3189243	50004745	We look forward to returning next summer!				

3266891	50004750	A fabulous stay - planning our next visit already ---SEP---		80005109	Thank you for taking time to write a review.	
3266891	50004751	We had an amazing weekend mini break here.		80005110	I am so pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us - Bucks Fizz at breakfast is always a treat, we will always cater for dietary requirements where we can glad it was a tasty breakfast - I am sure it set you up for the day.	
3266891	50004752	Lovely bed and breakfast with tastefully designed rooms.		80005111	We look forward to seeing you again maybe for the Christmas Markets next year!	
3266891	50004753	The shower in our room was a bit snug for my husband who is over 6ft so we would consider this when we selected our room next time we stay.				
3266891	50004754	Fab breakfast especially the complimentary Buck's Fizz and smoothie of the day.				
3266891	50004755	Offered a vegetarian breakfast which was really tasty.				
3266891	50004756	Great that there is car parking for guests so you don't have to worry about finding a parking space for the weekend.				
3266891	50004757	Staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble, they are able to provide info and advice and the discount card they give with the room key is great for savings at certain restaurants and attractions				

3174625	50004760	Beautiful resort ---SEP---		80005122	Dear Guest Thank you for the great review and recommending us.	
3174625	50004761	This is a beautiful resort, nice amenities, rooms, and very friendly staff.		80005123	I hope we get to welcome you back again in the near future!	
3174625	50004762	We went to the winerie and their wine was nice.		80005124	Kind regards, David	
3174625	50004763	Also went to Mica and the food was absolutely delicious.				
3174625	50004764	Would highly recommend for a nice romantic weekend away.				

3231407	50004770	Ridiculously AWFUL ---SEP---		80005135	Dear Jennifer B I apologize that your stay was less than satisfactory.	
3231407	50004771	Our poor experience started with check in.		80005136	The hot water issue was definitely inconvenient and we worked as quickly as we could do get the company out to fix the boiler issue.	
3231407	50004772	The girls at the desk couldn't smile or even bother to be passably poliye.		80005137	I apologize that you felt the staff was not polite.	
3231407	50004773	We checked into this hotel for a cheer competition.		80005138	I was personally working that night as was the front office manager, so I am sad to hear this.	
3231407	50004774	The night of our competition the entire hotel is out of hot water.		80005139	Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience of the hot water issue.	
3231407	50004775	We have a team of 30 seven year olds who compete at the crack of dawn tomorrow and none of them can shower.		80005140	Katie Stuart General Manager	
3231407	50004776	Not to mention I have been on the road traveling all day and now can't even get cleaned up and have a quick shower.				
3231407	50004777	Management is so non-chalant, and basically says sorry about your luck.				
3231407	50004778	This does not even begin to cover the fraying carpets, and dirty bathroom sink.				
3231407	50004779	This hotel is overpriced, do not stay here!				

3206646	50004780	OK quality/price ---SEP--- Ok place for a business trip.		80005151	Dear Gwen K Thank you for your review, it is great to receive feedback.	
3206646	50004781	The wifi is terribly slow everywhere (meeting rooms, bar/restaurant or bedrooms).		80005152	We are currently focusing on the wifi speed - although fast in some areas it is an area we are looking to improve in the near future.	
3206646	50004782	The meeting rooms are large and comfortable.		80005153	Kind regards	
3206646	50004783	Food is brasserie style and average.				
3206646	50004784	Good beds.				

3207348	50004790	Beautiful clean hotel, but you can hear everyone!		80005164	wintermommy2119, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience!	
3207348	50004791	---SEP---		80005165	I am so pleased to read that you had such a pleasant and comfortable stay, despite some noisy neighbors.	
3207348	50004792	My husband booked this hotel for us and our two daughters as a surprise.		80005166	We look forward to welcoming you, your husband, and your girls back very soon!	
3207348	50004793	The hotel is beautiful, very clean and the rooms are a nice size, and were very clean as well.		80005167	Regards, Kevin McMullin Assistant General Manager	
3207348	50004794	The beds are comfort adjustable.				
3207348	50004795	However, you could hear other hotel guests and almost every door close (although our neighbors weren't trying to be quiet at all).				
3207348	50004796	The pool was nice and warm.				
3207348	50004797	The hotel staff was very kind and attentive.				
3207348	50004798	They have a breakfast bar which was a little over $10.				
3207348	50004799	It was good food, and they combined our two girls' breakfast, which was kind since my 3 year old just had a Bowl Of cereal.				
3207348	50004800	I would try staying here again.				
3207348	50004801	Maybe with more considerate hotel guests it may be more quiet.				

3227845	50004810	Funky and friendly ---SEP---		80005178	Hi Carolinee0027, Thank you for this fantastic review of our hotel, I am ever so pleased to see that you had such a wonderful and memorable stay with us.	
3227845	50004811	I was in a small double on the fourth floor with a sea view.		80005179	I'm so glad you loved the little extra touches in your room, its something we pride are selfs on here at the Artist Residence.	
3227845	50004812	The bed was very comfortable and the shower was well equipped with good quality shower gel and body lotion.		80005180	We really hope to see you in the near future!	
3227845	50004813	There was plenty storage space and a lift was available.		80005181	Many thanks, James, Mel & Rachel and all the AR Team	
3227845	50004814	I liked the touch of the radio being left on playing music when the room had been cleaned and I fell on the caramel wafer left with the tea and coffee.				
3227845	50004815	The art work on the bedroom walls was a nice touch, although some rooms are more subdued in style and some are more intrusive.				
3227845	50004816	Downstairs we sat in the small sitting room enjoying a glass of wine before an excellent dinner served in the restaurant.				
3227845	50004817	The staff (and many of the clientele) were generally significantly younger than me.				
3227845	50004818	They were friendly, well informed about the food and wine they were serving and very helpful in phoning around restaurants on the evening when we didn't eat in.				
3227845	50004819	Don't stay here if you like your hotels corporate and predictable.				
3227845	50004820	Do stay here if you want something memorable where you leave smiling.				

3281134	50004830	Great in every respect ---SEP---		80005192	Dear Browny0, I‚Äôm pleased our location was so convenient for all your needs, certainly a drawcard for all types of travellers to Sydney with the convenience of everything you would need at your doorstep with views of Hyde Park, St Marys Cathedral and the Middle Harbour.	
3281134	50004831	This hotel has everything down to a fine art.		80005193	Our associates do indeed endeavour to assist our guests whenever possible and I‚Äôm delighted they continue to provide such great customer service.	
3281134	50004832	The Staff are wonderful, check in is efficient, rooms are well appointed and the room service that I ordered was top notch.		80005194	Thank you for your feedback!	
3281134	50004833	The location is nice, situated on Hyde park and close to the CBD and lots of restaurants.		80005195	Warm regards, Bernhard Langer Hotel Manager	
3281134	50004834	I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, couples especially, though it would be a nice business hotel too.				

3239705	50004840	Cool and Unique ---SEP---		80005206	Scottmbreaux, thank you for taking the time to leave us this 4 star review and for letting us know how Mrs. Lee was able to make you feel at home with us at B Ocean Resort!	
3239705	50004841	The B is a very unique place and is the reason I gave it a 4.		80005207	We hope you will B our guests again soon.	
3239705	50004842	Some rooms are nicer than others but they were clean and contemporary.				
3239705	50004843	For an older hotel, built in the heyday, it is a cool place to stay.				
3239705	50004844	Like most hotels, it has its pros and cons				
3239705	50004845	but overall It is a great value.				
3239705	50004846	Most all of the staff are kind and courteous and on point.				
3239705	50004847	We had trouble with the contracted cleaning crew not allowing us to eat in the lobby during their cleaning routine.				
3239705	50004848	It was a group of us and we were not ready to go back to the room, we wanted to stay in a community area but the Cleaning crew did not allow us.				
3239705	50004849	We stayed anyway.				
3239705	50004850	This was at no fault of the Hotel.				
3239705	50004851	I would like to give a shout out to Mrs. Lee who took great care of our group and myself and made me feel at home, greeting me every day and making sure we were well taken care of, Thank you, Mrs. Lee!				

3181502	50004860	Nice hotel, excellent pizza!		80005218	Dear Katie B, Thank you for posting your review, I'm delighted you found the hotel bedrooms comfortable and that the hotel overall met your needs.	
3181502	50004861	---SEP---		80005219	Its always nice to receive positive feedback regarding staff friendliness and your comments will be shared.	
3181502	50004862	We only stayed one night of our trip here, but it was a lovely hotel.		80005220	Glad you enjoyed the pizza	
3181502	50004863	The room was clean and well furnished, bathroom was a comfortable size, and the staff was very friendly.		80005221	and I hope we can look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3181502	50004864	We ate dinner in the restaurant and ordered Guinness and pizza.		80005222	Don't forget for the best offers book direct on our website.	
3181502	50004865	(We recommend the pepperoni and pineapple!)				
3181502	50004866	Delicious food in a modern atmosphere.				

3227586	50004870	Service was incredible ---SEP---		80005233	Thank you for your wonderful comments which are very much appreciated.	
3227586	50004871	I stayed here with my mum in August and we had a beautiful stay.		80005234	We will share them with all the team who will be so pleased.	
3227586	50004872	The room was lovely.		80005235	We look forward to your return.	
3227586	50004873	We requested twin beds before we arrived.				
3227586	50004874	We got there and it was a double but it was changed within an hour.				
3227586	50004875	Afternoon tea was great.				
3227586	50004876	Breakfast was brilliant, staff were very attentive and were very helpful.				
3227586	50004877	Would come back again for definite				

3307744	50004880	Don't stay here for a relaxing spa-break ---SEP--- Just stayed two nights in the main hotel.		80005246	Thank you for your recent review on this site, and I am aware that you used Trip Advisor as part of your decision making process when choosing to book to stay with us.	
3307744	50004881	Positives: - the breakfast was really good, lots of choice, frequently replenished and a lovely setting.		80005247	It is very regrettable that you did not enjoy your stay as much as you might have, certainly you would have experienced a less than smooth check out when the local sub-station failed on the Saturday morning, Hotel bedrooms, public areas and Cottages were plunged into darkness, and additionally we lost all power to our electrical and communication systems for around two hours, thankfully there was natural daylight for many!	
3307744	50004882	Disappointments: - We stayed at the Headland as it was advertised as somewhere for a romantic and luxurious retreat, and neither of us have any issues with children running around the lounge areas, being noisy or causing a mess.		80005248	I am sorry that you did not enjoy one of two ‚ÄôTower‚Äô rooms that we have here, they are very quirky in many respects but the one you occupied whilst furnished beautifully, definitely does not have an ocean view, if we had been aware of your dis satisfaction, I am sure we may have been able to have selected a more agreeable choice for you to consider.	
3307744	50004883	However, the spa really shouldn't be for children.		80005249	You were quite correct in assuming that there is an additional water pump for this room and it would have failed when we lost our power, apologies for the disruption it clearly caused prior to your check out.	
3307744	50004884	We planned to visit the spa Saturday morning before going out for lunch, but when we arrived the pool (which is small, fine for a spa-dip) was literally full to the brim with children and babies.		80005250	Newquay is very much viewed as the capital of beach holidays in this country.	
3307744	50004885	Some of them were quite boisterous, play-fighting, jumping in and generally running amok.		80005251	With seven sandy beaches, most of which are lifeguarded, fantastic water sports on offer and of course great surfing it is easy to see why!	
3307744	50004886	"Some of the parents were sat in the ""relaxation area"" watching them through the glass."		80005252	Perched above Fistral beach and surrounded by surf schools, we hope always to be inundated with families wishing to enjoy all of these outdoor pursuits and more.	
3307744	50004887	Children were also in the jacuzzi, so we couldn't even relax in there away from the main pool.		80005253	The Headland is the perfect spot to be staying, whether in the Hotel or opting for a Cottage self ‚Äìcatering style holiday.	
3307744	50004888	When we mentioned this to the spa reception, the girl was understanding (she said it would never have been the case where she worked previously), but that the area used to be a children's play area with ball pits etc, and that the hotel was family-friendly.		80005254	The Headland has already begun, and shortly after the school holidays, will be offering some of the very best experiences in Spa Breaks throughout the year; in fact we can‚Äôt wait to show everyone just how good they are planned to be!	
3307744	50004889	I really must reiterate that neither of us are anti-children in any way, but a spa is a spa, it isn't a playground.		80005255	Meanwhile we will never be advertising specific packages or portraying to be the perfect choice for a relaxing spa break within a school holiday period.	
3307744	50004890	Do NOT stay here if you are expecting a relaxing spa-break, because you won't get it.		80005256	Best wishes for now and I genuinely hope that you might be able to visit us once again during a different time of year to experience the very best of what we will have to offer in facilities and treats!	
3307744	50004891	The spa is child-free from 6pm...				
3307744	50004892	just when you want to be getting ready for an evening meal.				
3307744	50004893	A complete disappointment.				
3307744	50004894	-				
3307744	50004895	The hotel is very dog-friendly.				
3307744	50004896	Luckily, we both like dogs.				
3307744	50004897	What we don't really like is sitting in the lounge for a quiet drink, and being faced with a horde of barking dogs, who all seem to get upset with each other.				
3307744	50004898	Don't stay here if you don't like dogs, or, even worse, have an allergy.				
3307744	50004899	The room had dog hair all over the floor. -				
3307744	50004900	"On arrival, we were ""upgraded"" to a tower room."				
3307744	50004901	Now, this is an awkward one to write, as we were told we were upgraded, and so naturally we were grateful for that.				
3307744	50004902	However, we booked (and paid quite a lot for!)				
3307744	50004903	an ocean-view room.				
3307744	50004904	The tower room had a view of the golf course and a building site, and if you sat on one side of the window-sill, you could peer at half a view of the coast.				
3307744	50004905	We discussed it a few times during our stay...on the one hand, we were told we were upgraded, on the other, we really wanted an ocean-view.				
3307744	50004906	We didn't really know what to do, and the room was a lovely size, so we stayed put.				
3307744	50004907	But do be aware of this if you really want that ocean view.				
3307744	50004908	In the hotel's defence, we didn't complain at the time.				
3307744	50004909	-The hotel suffered a power-cut during our stay.				
3307744	50004910	These things happen, and we understand that.				
3307744	50004911	However, we had no water in our room (being so high in the hotel, there must have been an electric pump or something), and so we had to traipse down the stairs to the spa and shower in the dark.				
3307744	50004912	I then had to go out to lunch (we booked Rick Stein's restaurant as a special treat) with wet hair.				
3307744	50004913	Now, this isn't a huge problem...what is a problem is the complete lack of customer service during or after this.				
3307744	50004914	A simple note under the door apologising for the inconvenience would have been nice, or perhaps an offer of a complimentary drink in the bar.				
3307744	50004915	Instead, we got complete indifference when we checked out and were asked how our stay was.				
3307744	50004916	"When we said our stay hadn't been as relaxing or pleasant as we had hoped, the receptionist said ""oh, i'm sorry to hear about that"", and then gave us our bill."				
3307744	50004917	Perhaps i'm old-fashioned, but I would have tried to compensate in some way.				
3307744	50004918	All-in-all, the hotel was a huge disappointment.				
3307744	50004919	The spa, in particular, was awful and I urge any of you looking for a spa-break to look elsewhere.				

3197504	50004920	Overpriced and overrated ---SEP---		80005267	Thank you for taking to time to share your experience following your recent stay.	
3197504	50004921	A tired hotel that is of desperate need of a upgrade.		80005268	I am sorry to read that you feel the hotel is overpriced for the accommodations.	
3197504	50004922	The rooms are clean enough and reasonably well equipped.		80005269	The long awaited hotel renovations have begun and will be ongoing through to the early part of 2018.	
3197504	50004923	$200 a night is way overpriced and I'm sure there are better hotels in St. John's for less.		80005270	I have shared your comments about the breakfast and bar menus with the restaurant and kitchen management team.	
3197504	50004924	The breakfast and bar menus need a serious revamp and need some decent alternatives to the deep fried greasy food.		80005271	I can advise that new menus will be in place very soon.	
3197504	50004925	Very disappointing for a Marriot brand!		80005272	I do hope you will consider staying at the Delta St. John's hotel again in the future.	

3315602	50004930	Location is excellent!		80005283	Thank you very much for your feedback on your recent stay at Melbourne Metropole Central.	
3315602	50004931	---SEP---		80005284	It is nice to receive 5 stars and we are glad you like the area.	
3315602	50004932	I stayed here for three nights with my SIL and my two children.		80005285	It is great we were able to rectify the situation with regard to the room.	
3315602	50004933	First day of check in they put us in a room that doesn‚Äôt accommodate 4 people (1 single, 1 queen)........		80005286	The studio, Junior suite and 1 bedroom have a maximum occupancy of 3 people, so if staff indicated otherwise then an apology is in order.	
3315602	50004934	reception guy kept saying ‚Äúwell we have a problem‚Äù our reply ‚Äúno you have a problem, it‚Äôs not our fault or problem, it was booked by one of your staff !		80005287	I hope we get to see you again and you have a chance to experience the wonderful meals on offer.	
3315602	50004935	Any Hoo, problem solved and we all moved on.		80005288	Kind Regards Gavin Wishnowski	
3315602	50004936	Hotel is quiet and a perfect location, rooms are well maintained and generously sized.				
3315602	50004937	I would definitely stay here again, as they offer secure parking for free and although we didn‚Äôt eat here the meals looked pretty good.				
3315602	50004938	Fantastic area for food and shopping, public transport etc.				
3315602	50004939	It was a great stay!				
3315602	50004940	Highly recommended!				

3167718	50004950	Short stay ---SEP--- Dale at reception was very pleasant and polite and nothing was too much trouble.		80005299	Dear Debbie Thank you for choosing to stay at Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour and taking the time to provide us with feedback.	
3167718	50004951	Staff in the restaurant a bit slow at bringing requested coffee etc, however Eric made up for this with his wit and friendly manner and he made sure we were well looked after.		80005300	I will be sure to share your comments with our team especially Dale and Eric.	
3167718	50004952	Thank you Eric for making our stay more pleasant.		80005301	I am sure that this feedback will serve as an encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services.	
3167718				80005302	Please feel free to contact us directly if we can be of any further assistance or ‚ÄúLIKE‚Äù our Facebook page to see what else is happening within our hotel and we hope your next visit will be another memorable stay.

3182747	50004963	Waiting for the breakfast table.				
3182747	50004964	Children not allowed at the bar (we wanted to play cards there).				
3182747	50004965	No citymaps, instead the tip to go to the tourist information.				
3182747	50004966	Parking place is outsourced.

3318133	50004972	Decor is a bit dated but rate was good ¬£45 per night compared to many others.		80005329	Ken Ellington, General Manager	
3318133	50004973	There is also a fitness centre and swimming pool at the same time plenty of parking.

3195173	50004983	The free breakfast was great as well.

3320703	50005030	Excellent Orlando vacation ---SEP---		80005390	Hello WJHM2012, I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at the resort.	
3320703	50005031	We stayed at the Four Seasons over Memorial Day weekend.		80005391	I am so glad that you and your family had a wonderful experience, and I am thrilled that you felt a warm welcome from our team throughout your stay.	
3320703	50005032	The hotel managed to exceed our already very high expectations - the room was beautiful, spacious and well-furnished with a terrific view, the pools and Explorer Island were great and the food and drink were top-notch.		80005392	I hope you and your family will come visit us again soon!	
3320703	50005033	What really set our stay apart was the service - everyone was incredibly solicitous and accommodating, from consistent attention at the poolside restaurants to making sure we were able to get into an already-booked character breakfast.		80005393	All the best, Charles Fisher, Resort Manager	
3320703	50005034	Even the housekeeping was notably excellent, down to tiny details like wrapping our phone charging cords.				
3320703	50005035	The shuttles were convenient and the extra magic hours benefit is really great for the parks.				
3320703	50005036	Our 5 year old absolutely loved the hotel as well, and having the lazy river and waterslides to return to made leaving the parks a lot easier.				
3320703	50005037	It's hard to imagine coming to Disney and staying anywhere else.				

3204529	50005040	Your home away from home....		80005404	Dear Kelly K, Thank you for taking your time to provide feedback regarding your most recent stay at Meriton Serviced Apartments Kent Street.	
3204529	50005041	---SEP---		80005405	We are so glad to hear that you had a great stay with us and that you were able to unwind and relax in your apartment after a day out in the city.	
3204529	50005042	I have always enjoyed staying at the Meriton, especially the one on Kent Street, because it's so centralised to everything and next to George Street, which is the main street in the city.		80005406	Its great to see that you utilised our express check out service upon departure.	
3204529	50005043	Booking online was easy as I booked the room on the same day I had checked in.		80005407	The express check out option offers a quick and easy departure which is especially convenient when heading off to work or the Airport.	
3204529	50005044	I felt relaxed and really needed to unwind after a long weekend and had work the following day.		80005408	Kelly K, thank you once again for your feedback, we look forward to welcoming you back to Meriton Serviced Apartments Kent Street in the near future Kind Regards, Katie H Senior Manager on Duty	
3204529	50005045	The room was spacious and the facilities were great and the King Size bed was so comfortable, that I slept so easily.				
3204529	50005046	I checked out early the next day by completing the early check out envelope, which is so convenient, because I would rather just return the key cards and check out straight away instead of waiting in line and physically returning the key cards to the staff members.				
3204529	50005047	I would always want to stay at the Mertion.				

3198716	50005050	Hmmmm... OK, but could definitely be improved!		80005419	Thank you David W, I appreciate you taking the time to inform us about your stay.	
3198716	50005051	---SEP---		80005420	We encourage feedback and hope to be better in the future.	
3198716	50005052	Breakfast was bad...		80005421	I am sorry to hear that you were not pleased with breakfast.	
3198716	50005053	Room... just ok.		80005422	I wish i had more information, but i can tell you that we offer a variety of items that we switch throughout the week.	
3198716	50005054	A/C didn't cool room quickly.		80005423	We also have other items that we can make off the menu to ensure that you are satisfy.	
3198716	50005055	Beds were double NOT QUEENS.		80005424	All you have to do is ask :)	
3198716	50005056	Location was good.		80005425	I am glad the team made a strong impression.	
3198716	50005057	Service was good.		80005426	I hope you do come back!	
3198716	50005058	Should have found a little better quality place.		80005427	Best regards, Shalai	
3198716	50005059	Would stay again, but very wary of conditions.				
3198716	50005060	Will look for another hotel next time.				

3244715	50005070	Beautiful place to stay, views, hospitality, food all top notch!		80005438	We are really pleased that you enjoyed relaxing in our Cottage and taking a soak in our outdoor spa pool.	
3244715	50005071	---SEP---		80005439	And thank you for your nice review and the great conversation over breakfast in the sunshine.	
3244715	50005072	My husband & I had the pleasure of staying in the cottage for 3 nights after driving around the South Island for 2 weeks.		80005440	The all-natural timber construction of our Cottage and Bed & Breakfast can sometimes make some noises at night that people may not be used to ‚Äì especially if you are a light sleeper ‚Äì so it‚Äôs good to know that the earplugs we have on hand were just the thing you needed!	
3244715	50005073	What a great place to unwind from all that driving & sight seeing.				
3244715	50005074	We didn't leave the first day at all, just happy to relax in such a nice environment.				
3244715	50005075	We BBQ'ed on the deck, sat in the spa, read & enjoyed looking out over the valley.				
3244715	50005076	As mentioned by some other guests, we also had quite a lot of wood creaking during the nights but otherwise everything was perfect.				
3244715	50005077	Those provided ear plugs are helpful for those that may want/need them.				

3184406	50005080	My stay at the Alohilani and my first trip to Hawaii ---SEP---		80005451	Aloha Rajan D, Mahalo for choosing us.	
3184406	50005081	What can I say about the Alohilani.....in short, just amazing!		80005452	We're glad you enjoyed your stay and that you had positive encounters with our amazing staff.	
3184406	50005082	I was in contact with the hotel 2 weeks before I actually arrived for my holiday		80005453	We're also happy to hear you liked the Longboard Club and our great location in Waikiki.	
3184406	50005083	and it was clear to me that the entire Alohilani team wanted me to have an amazing experience during my stay.		80005454	It was a pleasure to host you and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.	
3184406	50005084	I also want to state that this focus and attention to customer experience covered the entire team, from the General Manager, through to the events team, the front desk staff, the pool team, bar staff, restaurant staff etc........		80005455	Mahalo, Guest Services	
3184406	50005085	I stayed at the hotel for 8 days, and everything was perfect.				
3184406	50005086	The hotel itself is great and has a boutique feel which is what I was looking for.				
3184406	50005087	Additionally the location is perfect in that you are right on Waikiki Beach and so have an easy option of chilling in the infinity pool or taking a walk across the street to the beach or even walking down to the hustle and bustle of downtown; everything is literally on your doorstep.				
3184406	50005088	I also had access to the Long Board Club which I would advise everyone to get.				
3184406	50005089	This provided me with a little exclusivity as well as breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks.				
3184406	50005090	The real value of the Long Board Club for me though, was the fact that if I wanted some downtime to relax or read my book, then I always had the option of walking across from the infinity pool to the Long Board Club and chilling in a cabana, which was always available.				
3184406	50005091	I absolutely loves this hotel and if I go back to Oahu again, I will only stay here!!!				
3184406	50005092	Well done Alohilani team..........great work!				

3219703	50005100	A wonderful place to slow down during a trip to Ireland ---SEP---		80005466	Dear Mikecd, Thank you for taking your time to leave us feedback regarding your stay with us.	
3219703	50005101	We stayed 2 nights after almost 2 weeks of a hectic but enjoyable driving holiday around Ireland.		80005467	It is a pleasure to hear you enjoyed your time spent here so much, I can only hope all of your time here in Ireland was as delightful.	
3219703	50005102	It is not really a castle compared to those in England or Scotland, it is more a large medieval manor house - it is about 200 years old and built in a medieval style.		80005468	The castle is a Manor House built in medieval Neo gothic style.	
3219703	50005103	However, it is very comfortable, the staff is fantastic and the dining very good.		80005469	The building was built in 1833 and it stayed as a Manor House for many years before becoming a sanatarium and the existence of the building being threatened when the roof was to be taken off.	
3219703	50005104	Beautiful rooms and comfy lounge/bar area makes it a great place to unwind.		80005470	Fortunately it was purchased by Marshall Doran in the 70's and restored to its current glory.	
3219703	50005105	Stephen in the bar made our stay particularly enjoyable.		80005471	Marshall was an avid collector of all things old and has a beautiful collection on display in our museum which we do tours of daily at 11am, 2pm and 4pm.	
3219703	50005106	The surrounding woods and walking trails are very nice.		80005472	I do hope you get a chance to enjoy our guided tour at another point in time.	
3219703	50005107	The only thing average were the breakfasts - they offer the same Irish breakfast as anywhere else with nothing special; perhaps even fewer options than some of the smaller B&B we stayed at.		80005473	I am sorry however to hear you found breakfast average.	
3219703	50005108	This was a bit of a surprise compared to the gourmet dining in the evening.		80005474	We do serve a range of continental breakfast on our buffet and also our cook to order and full Irish.	
3219703				80005475	We feel the menu offered is a normal breakfast menu as people do request.	
3219703				80005476	We do have a cafe in our courtyard also should you have decided to sample something different they do a range of different dishes on their Brunch menu.	
3219703				80005477	I do hope you get a chance to visit the castle again as we would be delighted to have the opportunity to welcome you back.	
3219703				80005478	Warm Regards, Shannen	

3320717	50005110	Great Place to Stay ---SEP---		80005489	Thank you for your lovely review of your stay.	
3320717	50005111	This motel is perfectly placed if you have to visit the hospital as it is straight across the road, you can leave your car at the Motel and walk across the road.		80005490	It is great to hear that the new disability accessible room designs are working well.	
3320717	50005112	We stayed in the 2 bedroom unit - it is perfect if you need a disabled unit - as it has a ramp to the door and a large wet area bathroom.		80005491	Kit Kat, the cat will miss you, until the next time!	
3320717	50005113	Hosts were very friendly and helpful.				
3320717	50005114	The motel cat made us feel very welcome as well.				

3273415	50005120	Dogs ---SEP--- Very nice room.		80005502	Thanks dnbscar.	
3273415	50005121	Dog friendly, had no problem and dog park 1 block away.		80005503	Thank you and your doggie for choosing the River Inn for your recent visit to DC.	
3273415	50005122	About a mile or more from national mall so you may need transportation.		80005504	We love our furry friends and they love us with our pet friendly amenities and dog park just down the street!	
3273415	50005123	Trader Joes nearby and room had a kitchen so breakfast and dinner were reasonable.		80005505	We hope to see you back soon.	
3273415	50005124	Would stay here again on return trip.				
3273415	50005125	ALL of staff very nice and helpful.				

3240833	50005130	Nice Place to Stay ---SEP---		80005516	Thank you for choosing the Best Western Music Capital Inn for your recent stay in Branson.	
3240833	50005131	Everything about this stay went smoothly.		80005517	We are glad that you enjoyed your stay.	
3240833	50005132	Friendly service, clean facilities, quiet room, decent breakfast provided, up close parking, free wifi AND computer access.		80005518	I understand that hotel beds are often not like the bed at home, but we do replace them on a rotational basis and if you inform our staff we would be happy to help you find a mattress more to your liking.	
3240833	50005133	Only issue: SOFT bed.		80005519	We look forward to seeing you again!	
3240833	50005134	Many people probably like it - just not my preference.		80005520	Sue Gordy, GM	

3277972	50005140	Heartless ---SEP--- Cancelled flight in Europe with cascading delays so we couldn‚Äôt be there for our booking.		80005531	Thank you for your review, Indian036.	
3277972	50005141	Not even a partial refund despite notifying them shortly after our flight was cancelled.		80005532	I'm sorry to hear of this.	
3277972	50005142	We did stay there last year, but found the ‚Äòfree‚Äô drink at the bar to be a bit of a con.		80005533	I would welcome the opportunity to rectify this and show more flexibility.	
3277972	50005143	The convenience of its airport location will probably be overridden by our experience yesterday when travel plans are made in the future.		80005534	Please get in touch and ask for Kan, our Rooms Division Manager.	
3277972				80005535	- Boram Kim | Hotel Manager	

3217220	50005150	One night away to watch a football match in Bangor ---SEP--- Had a lovely one night stay in the Castle Hotel, Parking was easy and free, room was small and cosy, food in the bar was fabulous and very reasonable and breakfast was delicious, quick and comfortable with the daily paper what more could one want.		80005546	Thank you for your great review!	
3217220				80005547	Lovely to read that our team impressed and we all look forward to welcoming you back very soon!	

3325979	50005160	New motel of choice ---SEP--- Lovely lady on check-in.		80005558	Dear Inquiryagent, Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay with us.	
3325979	50005161	Room was a newer refurbished room which was large and clean.		80005559	I'm so pleased that you found your stay so comfortable that we are now your preferred motel in Warrnambool!	
3325979	50005162	Bed was very comfortable as was the pillow which I am usually very picky about.		80005560	We look forward to welcoming you back.	
3325979	50005163	Towels were not the fluffiest I have experienced but they were still very soft and absorbent.		80005561	Kind regards, Kim	
3325979	50005164	Good location and close to the shops and various food outlets.				
3325979	50005165	I have stayed in many motels in Warrnambool and this one is now my motel of choice when staying in Warrnambool.				
3325979	50005166	As they say in the classics ....				
3325979	50005167	I'll be back.				

3223860	50005170	Beautifully decorated and AMAZING Fusion Tea!		80005572	Dear megga2015, On behalf of everybody here at Clontarf Castle, I would like thank you for your very kind comments regarding your experience here at Clontarf Castle.	
3223860	50005171	---SEP---		80005573	Afternoon tea is an experience that the team always try to make a special and I am thrilled to hear that on this occasion you were provided with the same exceptional experience.	
3223860	50005172	My husband and I along with my parents wanted to stay at a castle on our trip to Ireland.		80005574	It is also a pleasure to read that Emma and Kathlyn contributed so highly to your wonderful Afternoon Tea experience.	
3223860	50005173	We chose to stay at Clontarf based on our itinerary and TripAdvisor reviews.		80005575	I will pass on your comments to Emma and Kathlyn who will be very encouraged and delighted to read them.	
3223860	50005174	While the castle hotel is definitely more updated and renovated than perhaps other castle hotels might be, it still has beautiful decor.		80005576	We really do appreciate you taking the time and trouble to post your review and we hope it is not too long before we have the privilege and the pleasure of welcoming you back.	
3223860	50005175	I absolutely loved the way the foyer and rooms were decorated.		80005577	Jason Ormston General Manager	
3223860	50005176	The royal purple color was gorgeous!				
3223860	50005177	Our rooms were very comfortable.				
3223860	50005178	The only downside was the room my husband				
3223860	50005179	and I stayed in had a view to nothing through the window.				
3223860	50005180	However, the rooms were very clean and the air-conditioning was very nice to have during the warm summer month of August.				
3223860	50005181	The absolute highlight of our time at Clontarf Castle hotel was our Fusion Tea!				
3223860	50005182	It was so elegant having a tea at a castle.				
3223860	50005183	Our servers, Karelyn and Emma were very knowledge about the different tea selections.				
3223860	50005184	We were invited to smell each variety and learned about what made up the teas.				
3223860	50005185	We had two courses - a savory course with delicious and fancy finger sandwiches, shooters, and other tasty mini food.				
3223860	50005186	The second course was my favorite, which was the dessert course filled with scrumptious and beautifully plated cakes, tarts, scones, etc.				
3223860	50005187	We were able to choose different tea for each course.				
3223860	50005188	It was so filling and so much fun.				
3223860	50005189	Karelyn and Emma went out of their way to talk with us and make us feel like royalty.				
3223860	50005190	I would highly recommend making reservations for the Fusion Tea!				
3223860	50005191	We also had breakfast at Clontarf.				
3223860	50005192	The breakfast buffet was very nice with lots of selection.				
3223860	50005193	Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Clontarf Castle Hotel and appreciate the friendly and accommodating staff.				

3171789	50005200	80th birthday afternoon tea.		80005588	Dear David Thank you very much for such a lovely recommendation.	
3171789	50005201	---SEP---		80005589	We are all delighted that your mother's 80th birthday tea was such a success and that you all spent a very pleasant few hours here.	
3171789	50005202	my parents were in newquay around my mums 80th birthday.so we booked a surprise 80th birthday afternoon tea for her.the staff put up some banners that we had taken in,as we sat outside waiting for our table.we had a lovely selection of sandwiches inc veggie,scones,mousses, petite fours,tea or coffee with top ups if required all served on traditional cake displays.really nice and something different.the staff couldn't do enough for us and did everything to keep it a total surprise.they were very polite,courteous,friendly,efficient which made for a lovely few hours there so many thanks to everyone at the headland hotel-it was especially busy that day as they had a huge wedding on and other birthday parties		80005590	You are right when you say that our lovely staff couldn't do enough for you - it is always especially good when our guests recognise this, so thank you again.	
3171789	50005203	but they attended to all our needs really well.my parents were made up.so thankyou everyone.i hope you get to see this.an amazing location too with awesome views of fistral beach etc.RECOMMENDED.		80005591	We hope we will be able to welcome you all back in the future.	
3171789				80005592	Kind regards Wyn	

3263214	50005210	Short City Stay ---SEP---		80005603	Dear Kenneth D, Thank you for your feedback.	
3263214	50005211	Great location with a view over Darling Harbour,the staff were all very friendly, however we found it strange that a 4.5 star hotel supplies 1 star toilet paper and face tissues, especially when all the other toiletries are top class.		80005604	I am sorry to read of the double charge of breakfast, I will pass on these comments to our Food and Beverage Department.	
3263214	50005212	The shower recess had mildew between the tiles, which can be easily removed with a chlorine spray.		80005605	Please note that these incidences were a true exception to our normal practices.	
3263214	50005213	We used the fast check-out which was encouraged, but on returning home we received the final statement showing that we were charged twice for our pre-paid breakfasts.		80005606	Rest assured that we are taking the appropriate measures to address these problems and all our efforts have been concentrated on preventing future occurrences.	
3263214	50005214	We rang the hotel and the front desk told us that this had to be referred to a manager who would return our call within half an hour.		80005607	Kind Regards, Richard Holt General Manager	
3263214	50005215	After over an hour and a second call by us this simple error was resolved.				
3263214	50005216	Not good enough for an Accor Hotel!				
3263214	50005217	Warning: Tell breakfast reception that you have pre-paid and check your account before checking out and don't use fast check-out.				

3303994	50005220	Amazing budget hotel!		80005618	Good morning Jeremy W, Thank you for the review!	
3303994	50005221	---SEP---		80005619	We're so delighted to hear that you and your family found the suites nicely appointed and comfortable.

3303994	50005223	Fantastic suites.		80005621	We look forward to your return very soon.	
3303994	50005224	Friendly staff.		80005622	Best, David Cron General Manage

3175057	50005240	Weekend stay ---SEP---		80005648	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to post your review online, however I was disappointed to only receive a 3 star rating.	
3175057	50005241	Modern hotel ideally located for the station and Brighton town centre.		80005649	If you would please be so kind as to share how we could improve on our standards of service to achieve a higher rating, would be greatly appreciated?	
3175057	50005242	Rooms very functional, everything you need but lack any real character.		80005650	We are grateful for the recommendation and look forward to welcoming you and your family back soon again.	
3175057	50005243	Despite facing front of hotel found room very quiet.		80005651	Kindest regards, Dominic Sauls, General Manager	
3175057	50005244	Occasional noise from hallway door but couldn't hear anything from room next door.				
3175057	50005245	Bathroom spacious but shower had tendency to run hot and then cold.				
3175057	50005246	Did have trouble with heating spent one very hot night and found room cool when we got in in evening, but that was probably just us not setting it correctly!				
3175057	50005247	Would recommend for a short break when you don't need all the hotel nice bits (pools, spas etc) and just really need somewhere to sleep and shower.				

3232521	50005250	Delighted to be back!		80005662	Dear Michael It was great having you back at at K&Q again last month	
3232521	50005251	---SEP---		80005663	and we are glad you could attend out wine and cheese night which we host every other Tuesday.	
3232521	50005252	We get to NZ once a year and always try to arrange our itinerary so that we get to stay at the King and Queen Hotel Suites.		80005664	Thanks for your review and I look forward to seeing you again next time.	
3232521	50005253	Sorting out the region's other attractions is almost secondary.		80005665	Best regards, Luke Front Office Manager	
3232521	50005254	This was our fourth stay and the services on offer had been taken to a new level.				
3232521	50005255	The hotel is now linked to a range of restaurants, cafes and bars that cater for all possible dining options.				
3232521	50005256	The evening we arrived, the owner hosted a drinks evening and actively sought views on his guests' experiences, which was a great approach.				
3232521	50005257	This is a highly recommended hotel that we will continue to return to!				

3214482	50005260	Perfect Weekend Getaway ---SEP---		80005676	Thank you for giving us 5 stars!

3214482	50005262	A short walk to Times Square, the theaters and shopping.		80005678	I love how you described us	
3214482	50005263	The rooms are clean, comfy and well-appointed.		80005679	and I feel the exact same way, working with such great people makes coming to work pleasurable.	
3214482	50005264	The staff cheerful, efficient & oh, so helpful.		80005680	Your praises will go a long way.	
3214482	50005265	I don't think I'd stay elsewhere again.		80005681	I hope you come back soon and if I can ever be of assistance please let me know.

3244416	50005282	Wish the rooms had a little more sound proofing but overall the rooms were clean and spacious.		80005702	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

3217497				80005737	Thank you again for your review!	

3162963	50005310	Stunning Outlook ---SEP--- Beautiful ground.		80005748	Dear themack2, Thank you for your glowing review!	
3162963	50005311	Each 'tree house' with its own personal piece of paradise to look out onto.		80005749	I am so pleased you were able to enjoy some of the local attractions!	
3162963	50005312	The room had all we needed and was close to town.		80005750	With a distillery, numerous wineries, Gallery Walk and its many boutique shops, bush walking and glow worm caves, there is so much to see and do on Tamorine Mountain.	
3162963	50005313	We also did short day trips checking out some of the local waterfalls and the glow worm caves.		80005751	We look forward to welcoming you again soon.	
3162963	50005314	The room was extremely clean with breakfast brought to you each morning.		80005752	Warm regards, Shona Philps General Manager	
3162963	50005315	We sat eating out breakfast together while a wallaby hopped by.				
3162963	50005316	It was so relaxing and peaceful.				
3162963	50005317	We also had a delicious dinner at the restaurant.				
3162963	50005318	You can also book a massage where they come to your room and then you hop into the spa bath to finish off.				
3162963	50005319	It was all the little touches that I loved like the candles on the table.				
3162963	50005320	Spare candles and matches in the drawer, candles around the spa, tablecloth and cushions for furniture on the deck.				

3270801	50005330	Not close to town ---SEP---		80005763	Hello, Thank you very much for the great comments on our hotel.	
3270801	50005331	If you are flying in or have business at the nearby convention center this would be a convenient great location with fantastic facilities.		80005764	You are correct we are fairly new as we just opened in July 2013.	
3270801	50005332	If you're like us traveling by car and just looking for a place to stay it is a little out of the way.		80005765	We do take pride in our hotel and our staff work very hard to make sure it is very clean.	
3270801	50005333	The place felt new and was very clean.		80005766	We do offer a few extra things in our breakfast and our guest such as yourself as I can tell we're able to enjoy it.	
3270801	50005334	We have come to expect a lot from Fairfield Inn as most we have stayed at would get a very good rating.		80005767	I will make sure to pass along your comments to our staff.	
3270801	50005335	Clean, comfortable and nice places to stay.		80005768	We are only a few minutes from downtown	
3270801	50005336	Breakfast here was a real hit and better done than most places.		80005769	but I know if you are not from around here it can be a bit confusing.	
3270801	50005337	Not only did you get a good selection, including very fresh fruit, but they clearly knew how to make the cooked items correctly (not always the case).		80005770	Let us know next time you are here and we will make sure to give you directions to where you need to go.	
3270801				80005771	We hope you will be staying with us again soon.	
3270801				80005772	Monique Bourque	

3207395	50005340	Staff so friendly ---SEP---		80005783	Thank you for your review.	
3207395	50005341	We stay here when visiting relatives in Wetherby and it is the best value for money in the area.(if booked in advance)		80005784	Your comments about the friendliness of the staff have been passed on to the whole team, as positive feedback like that really gives all of us a huge boost so thank you.	
3207395	50005342	Rooms are always clean, staff always helpful.		80005785	We look forward to seeing you again the next time you are visiting your relatives in the area.	
3207395	50005343	Will stay there every time we visit.		80005786	Kind Regards Paul	

3274565	50005350	Friendly and comfortable ---SEP--- I‚Äôm in Bendigo for a two day conference.		80005797	Thanks Jon, our 'defrost stations' certainly come in handy on our frosty mornings, there's nothing worse than running numerous cups of water out to the car when you're in a hurry to leave.	
3274565	50005351	The Heritage is typical of a Motel stay in a regional town.		80005798	We're glad you enjoy your stay.	
3274565	50005352	Spacious rooms, friendly staff/owners, even a bucket of water and a window washer to defrost your car windows in the morning.		80005799	Safe travels	
3274565	50005353	Great value for money.				

3308171	50005360	Delighted to return to Matildas.		80005800	Hello Doherty01, thanks so much for your awesome five bubble review, we both appreciate that you took the time out of your day to post it.	
3308171	50005361	---SEP--- Excellent service.		80005801	We love it when return guests post reviews!	
3308171	50005362	The staff could not be more helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable.		80005802	I will pass on your comments to our team as they love a good review as well.	
3308171	50005363	They made our stay in Dubbo relaxed and pleasurable.		80005803	We look forward to seeing you again on your return to Dubbo, travel safe and regards Sharon and Murray.	
3308171	50005364	We will definitely stay here when we come back this way again.				

3196449	50005370	Loved it!!		80005814	Hello, Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3196449	50005371	---SEP---		80005815	We are so happy to hear that you loved your experience at Zoofari Lodge, and made many memories during your stay.	
3196449	50005372	This was a wonderful experience.		80005816	We hope you can come back and stay with us again in the future.	
3196449	50005373	Tents are amazing and beautiful especially the bathrooms.				
3196449	50005374	Our tent looked straight over the plains which was amazing to see giraffes walking around and feeding.				
3196449	50005375	The organised tours are fantastic as you get to see more behind the scenes with the animals.				
3196449	50005376	Seeing a rhino run along beside our bus because he knew that he would be receiving food is something I will always remember.				
3196449	50005377	Going to the elephant barn is also something to be seen.				
3196449	50005378	All of us being able to feed a giraffe a carrot was amazing.				
3196449	50005379	Food at the restaurant was very nice and everything was very well organised.				

3285047	50005380	So-So ---SEP---		80005827	Thank you for taking the time share your thoughts.	
3285047	50005381	This property was so-so and not up to Hampton or Hilton standard.		80005828	We are constantly working to improve our hotel and the comfort and stress free experience of our guest is the most important.	
3285047	50005382	There was this strange smell in the kings room, I think the small shed which they have next to King bed rooms facing IHOPS is the reason for that smell as water keeps accumulating over there after rain.		80005829	Have a great summer!	
3285047	50005383	Also before using the iron in the room check it out completely because the one I had in my room worked fine for a while and then within seconds leaked some rusted water spoiling my shirt, which I was suppose to wear for my meeting.				
3285047	50005384	I believe cleaning carpet, bed and rooms is what everybody does but taking care of small things like cleaning the iron before leaving it in the room for new guest to use is one of the things most of the hotels miss.				
3285047	50005385	The lobby was the smallest and usually people have to wait for others to stand for morning breakfast.				
3285047	50005386	Breakfast served lacked change and it was almost same stuff everyday, I am not sure why HAMPTON's all over US do not follow same standards.				
3285047	50005387	Also as they have the indoor pool which is very near to the lobby, people generally used walk in straight out of pool to the breakfast area as they the property have no signs asking them not to roam around in swimwear etc.				
3285047	50005388	The rooms were big and best thing is this property being opposite to Quail springs mall so that you can spend your day shopping or browsing.				
3285047	50005389	I have been to HAMPTON LA/ MICHIGAN and couple of others				
3285047	50005390	but I did not liked this compared to them.				

3250797	50005400	Lovely birthday weekend away for my partner ---SEP---		80005830	Dear Ellie M, Thank you for taking the time to review the Sandman Signature Hotel Newcastle, we are delighted to hear you had a lovely birthday weekend away.	
3250797	50005401	Great hotel with a lovely reception and welcoming staff.		80005831	We greatly appreciate your feedback.	
3250797	50005402	Room was fantastic with plenty of space and the shower was fabulous!		80005832	It is great to hear you would definitely stay again.	
3250797	50005403	I had emailed Reception prior to my one night stay and they had organised items such as a birthday cake and rose petals for my partner which made the stay even more special.		80005833	We would recommend to check out the best offers and promotions directly on our website for your next visit.	
3250797	50005404	Would definitely stay again :)		80005834	We will look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3250797				80005835	Kindest Regards, Debbie Guest Services Manager	

3225199	50005410	Grandmother's 97th birthday ---SEP--- Had a wonderful and warm welcome for an afternoon meal for my grandmother's birthday.		80005846	Thank you for your excellent review.	
3225199	50005411	Service was excellent.		80005847	I am delighted that you had a pleasant meal with us and look forward to your next visit.	
3225199	50005412	Was waited on by a lovely lady called Paige who did her best to make the occasion memorable.		80005848	I will share your comments with Paige.	
3225199	50005413	Would definitely recommend this place for special occasions.		80005849	Best regards Wael Elassal	

3173527	50005420	Fantastic value ---SEP---		80005850	G'day Chris R, We appreciate you taking the time to write a review and for your kind words and good to know that you enjoyed some of the local eateries.	
3173527	50005421	Host Jim was not only friendly but also very helpful with local eating suggestions & some recommendations.		80005851	We appreciate your comments regarding the bathrooms and despite the functionality the tiling is dated.	
3173527	50005422	To be picky I'd say the bathroom needed an update to its decor, & the pool was too warm to be refreshing.		80005852	We have been refreshing some bathrooms with the hope that a more significant refurbishment will be achievable in the medium term.	
3173527	50005423	Full Foxtel was a bonus, as is the option for 3 devices onto the free wifi - which was even pretty fast!		80005853	That said the cost of full replacement would be in order of $200,000 would have a significant impact upon tariffs and the value that we offer.	
3173527	50005424	Room decor good, beds very comfy, the suggested bistro at walking distance was fantastic food & value.		80005854	Sorry that the pool was too warm which can be an issue with outdoor pools in the middle of summer.	
3173527	50005425	DEFINITELY would stay again on a return trip to Ballarat.		80005855	Good to know that you found everything else to your liking and that you would definitely stay again on a return to Ballarat.	
3173527				80005856	Thanks and regards, Jim and Karen

3239808	50005444	Hotel facilites were good, we used the spa twice and had a massage.				
3239808	50005445	The restaurant in the sister hotel next door is great too, the Ventana.				
3239808	50005446	It rained the day we were going to go down to the beach (february though!)				
3239808	50005447	but having been there before the beach is really nice.				
3239808	50005448	Had very noisy neighbours next door maybe were just thin walls but not hotels fault.				
3239808	50005449	All in all a great hotel would reccommend to friends but would def pay the extra for our penthouse again!

3273262	50005462	Only draw back was that the head of our bed rested on the wall that was also the wall for the hallway, so we heard a lot of people coming in at all hours of the night, but this was expected since it was a holiday weekend.		80005892	See you soon!	
3273262	50005463	The breakfast was superb in the morning and we had so much fun, bus stop was right across the street and there are some nice restaurants nearby if you don't want to eat in the hotel's restaurant.		80005893	Regards Shane GM	
3273262	50005464	Overall we were very satisfied.

3294176	50005475	The rooms were large and comfortable and the kitchens provided were so convenient for enjoying the many leftovers from the dinners we enjoyed in the amazing local restaurants.				
3294176	50005476	We enjoyed great meals after visiting the sites around Foggy Bottom and Georgetown which are all in close proximity.				
3294176	50005477	The restaurant in the hotel was just as good with a menu full of delicious, well executed choices, and very reasonable prices as well.				
3294176	50005478	Upon our return after all our daily excursions we were always welcomed with smiles and always asked if there was anything we needed.				
3294176	50005479	Our thanks to the front desk : Elizabeth, Will, Cody, Adrienne and Kacem as well as the entire River Inn staff that made our stay so pleasant and memorable.

3264554	50005491	Close to Victoria and the Trans Canada Highway.		80005920	We hope to see you again soon.	
3264554	50005492	Lovely small town feel with an awesome waterfront.				
3264554	50005493	Will definitely recommend to others and we will stay here again.				

3213537	50005500	Clean and comfortable ---SEP--- Comfortable and clean accommodation.		80005931	Dear Hammacsoup, Thank you for sharing your feedback.	
3213537	50005501	It can get noisy at night as it is located above a pub and a pokies venue - you can occasionally hear the odd drunk guy yelling in the street.		80005932	I am glad you found your stay comfortable, clean, nicely located and found our team members friendly and helpful.	
3213537	50005502	Good location and very accessible to the city centre and Adelaide Airport.		80005933	We look forward to welcoming you back.	
3213537	50005503	Very friendly and helpful staff.		80005934	Kind Regards, Saqib Memon, General Manager.	

3167991	50005510	Good night sleep ---SEP---		80005945	"Dear Henk, I was worried when I saw your review started with "" I was disappointed "" but then I read on , and you were disappointed that you could not stay because we were booked out !"	
3167991	50005511	I was disappointed when we went through to Queensland that the motel was booked out as I had stopped there before about 6 years ago.		80005946	I am glad you like our refurbishments.	
3167991	50005512	So on the way back we did get accommodation and fond that it had been updated .We had room service which was on time ,rooms are big ,clean,modern decor,comfy bed and quiet for a good night sleep		80005947	We are very pleased with how they have come up.	
3167991				80005948	Hope to see you again.	

3250493	50005520	Food ---SEP---		80005959	Hi Teresa E, I'm very sorry you did not enjoy your food with us, this is certainly not our usual standard of service.	
3250493	50005521	I was on a visit to meet my niece in Court Hotel yesterday we had fish for lunch & it was like leather over cooked.		80005960	I'd appreciate it if you could please contact me directly on marketing@tullamorecourthotel.ie Kind Regards, Shannen	
3250493	50005522	Then her school-going son joined us & had the meanest portion of Lasagne served with a portion of chips costing (wait for it) 15.50 absolutely disgraceful & we will not be back never again.				

3277443	50005530	No Internet In Room ---SEP---		80005971	Dear Aleah M, I have responded to your concerns in greater detail by email.	
3277443	50005531	After 4 repeated complaints over 3 days, we never received assistance in fixing the problem to gain in room access to the internet.		80005972	We deeply regret that the internet failed in our front building during your stay.	
3277443	50005532	The only thing I can say about this hotel is that the beds were comfortable.		80005973	I hope that you will take me up on my offer and visit us once again.	
3277443	50005533	Staff customer service was poor.		80005974	Bob Williams - General Manager	
3277443	50005534	I would not stay here again.				

3294786	50005540	review ---SEP---		80005985	It was a pleasure to serve you as our guest during your recent stay at our hotel.	
3294786	50005541	The staff was very pleasant, very welcoming and friendly.		80005986	Thank you for your feedback and I am very happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3294786	50005542	Breakfast was outstanding and so was the staff.		80005987	Thank you again for staying with us and I hope that you will choose to stay with us again in the future when your travels bring you back to the Phoenix area.	
3294786	50005543	Pool is nice.				
3294786	50005544	The location feels too remote; it was a 15-20 minute drive to the stadium for spring training.				

3317180	50005550	Garden of the Gods Lodge - You won't want to leave!		80005998	We truly appreciate that you chose our Lodge for your break from RVing, and we're thrilled that your stay exceeded your expectations.	
3317180	50005551	---SEP---		80005999	Thanks for your kind words about our property and staff.	
3317180	50005552	My wife and I are moving to Colorado Springs and have spent two months in our motorhome traveling in Florida and the Gulf states.		80006000	The balcony photos you shared are gorgeous as well.	
3317180	50005553	I thought a stay at The Lodge at Garden of the Gods Club would be a good break before we move into an RV park to start our house hunting.		80006001	Please come back and visit us again soon, and in the meantime, good luck with your house hunting!	
3317180	50005554	BIG MISTAKE!				
3317180	50005555	We've enjoyed it here so very much we don't want to leave.				
3317180	50005556	It's hard to say what's best.				
3317180	50005557	The personnel, the ambiance, the food, the spa, the year-round outdoor pool (the list could go on) all while looking out at the Garden of the Gods with Pikes Peak as the backdrop...				
3317180	50005558	One of the most magnificent views you will ever see.				
3317180	50005559	There aren't any negatives - all positives - and I can wholeheartedly recommend this place.				

3322138	50005560	Maintains faith in Holiday Inn Express brand ---SEP---		80006012	Thank you for your comments regarding your stay at our hotel.	
3322138	50005561	Only stayed first night in Tampa here after late flight from NYC, (thereafter stayed with friends) but could have happily stayed longer.		80006013	We always appreciate feedback from our valued guests.	
3322138	50005562	On map didnt realise hotel so far from airport, but actually located to the east? of airport, however the hotel free shuttle bus negated any problems getting to the hotel - especially at 10:30pm.		80006014	It is our best tool to continually improve our facility and customer service.	
3322138	50005563	The hotel receptionist was friendly and due to my IHG hotels				
3322138	50005564	Loyalty card i was a given a room upgrade to a suite, which included a late check-out next day.				
3322138	50005565	The suite was clean and very roomy/ comfortable, tho the in-room aircon unit seemed a little noisy until got used to it.				
3322138	50005566	The en-suite bathroom seemed clean, the only problem encountered being the shower water controller was stiff and only ran HOT or Cold.				
3322138	50005567	As always, the free wifi enabled me to catch-up on the days email etc.				
3322138	50005568	Even tho suite at front of hotel, hotel situated far enough back off main hway not to hear traffic noise, and slept soundly on a comfortable King bed.				
3322138	50005569	Next morning Just made the ample free buffet breakfast in the cosy dining room overlooking the pool and river, before returning to room till noon checkout (actual late check-out poss til 2pm).				
3322138	50005570	Left a room maintainence (shower tap) card with reception on departure, which was acknowledged by email a couple of days later.				
3322138	50005571	The only possible negative for this hotel is its location away from the city which would make it hard to get around if staying a few days without a car.

3247086	50005721	We were woken at 3am by returning very noisy guests both outside and inside the hotel.		80006214	I am incredibly disappointed to read that the level of customer service that you experienced with our reception team does not live up to what either you nor I expected.	
3247086	50005722	When we complained, receptionist just laughed and said yeah we know.		80006215	I would like the opportunity investigate your issues further and would appreciate if your could contact me on either the hotel contact number or by email on operationsmanager.leedscitywest@premierinn.com.	
3247086	50005723	No offer under the guarantee.		80006216	Thank you once again for your feedback, my team and I look forward to welcoming you back to Leeds City West Premier Inn again in the near future.	
3247086	50005724	Apparently, it's not the hotel's fault if other guests wake you!		80006217	Ben Wattam Operations Manager	
3247086	50005725	Apart from that, the carpet was dirty and the heating was noisy and did not work properly, so the room was never comfortably warm.				
3247086	50005726	At least the bed was large and comfortable, the water was hot and the kettle worked.				
3247086	50005727	The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful.				
3247086	50005728	We only ate breakfast there.				
3247086	50005729	There was a good selection of food, the cooked breakfast was hot and very tasty.				
3247086	50005730	The only downside was very greasy hash browns.				

3247546	50005740	Great location in Waikiki & comfortable ---SEP---		80006228	HI Evan N, Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach.	
3247546	50005741	This hotel is strongly recommended for its location and the comfort of its rooms.		80006229	We appreciate your recommendations on our excellent location and comfortable accommodations in close proximity to all shopping, dining, and entertainment the island has to offer.	
3247546	50005742	This Hyatt property is centrally located in the Waikiki area.		80006230	We're glad you were able to take advantage of our public space and look forward to our next chance to welcome you back.	
3247546	50005743	It is near to shopping area, ROSS is next door.				
3247546	50005744	There is Jamba Juice and Starbucks on the ground floor.				
3247546	50005745	There are also restaurants nearby.				
3247546	50005746	The staff are helpful and friendly.				
3247546	50005747	After checking in a staff member will explain further of its facilities and services.				
3247546	50005748	We liked that you get a few dollars off if you choose not to have room serviced on certain days.				
3247546	50005749	We selected mountain view rooms which we enjoyed.				
3247546	50005750	The only issue is that there are no windows to open to get fresh air in the room.				
3247546	50005751	There is a pool area which is on the same floor as the lobby and bar.				
3247546	50005752	Strongly recommend.				

3166781	50005760	On Welbeck in Westminster ---SEP---		80006241	Dear Guest, Thank you for posting a review following you recent stay with us.

3166781	50005762	The Staff was attentive and our room was more then comfortable.		80006243	Marylebone Village is indeed special, with so many quant and interesting caf√©‚Äôs, pubs and shops (mostly local and very quirky) , there is something for absolutely everyone and another bonus as you mentioned is our proximity to Oxford Street and Covent Garden.	
3166781	50005763	At first I was worried that we had booked into one of those paint by the numbers businessman's housing locales but we ended up very pleased with our choice.		80006244	Whilst I am pleased you loved the area, it is also brilliant to read that you enjoyed our staff‚Äôs attentiveness and the comfort factior of your room.

3291062	50005777	Probably the only place we will stay from now on in Boston.				

3310863	50005780	Hotel front beautiful, rooms were dirty and old ---SEP---		80006273	Hi OrlaFor Ireland Thank you for your comments and feedback on The Emmet Hotel.	
3310863	50005781	From the front this boutique hotel looks impressive.		80006274	We are currently refurbishing the Hotel.	
3310863	50005782	The lobby is set up with a Victorian feel and the bar was nice.		80006275	Currently, we would have refurbished the majority of the public areas and over half of the bedrooms.	
3310863	50005783	That was where the good points ended.		80006276	Whilst some of the older rooms may be dated, they should be spotlessly clean .	
3310863	50005784	The rooms were old, dirty, loud and shoved together.		80006277	My apologies if yours was not, and I thank you again for your feedback	
3310863	50005785	Paint on the walls was all marked and scuffed.		80006278	so I can ensure that this does not happen again.	
3310863	50005786	The furniture didn't match.		80006279	Kindest regards Rob O'Keeffe	
3310863	50005787	The beds were lumpy.				
3310863	50005788	The bathroom was big but dirty.				

3260932	50005790	Sweet as ---SEP---		80006280	Thank you for this lovely review of your stay in The Loft.	
3260932	50005791	My boyfriend and i stayed in the appartment loft for two nights, it was very cosy and comfortable.		80006281	We are well placed as a base for lots of adventures including Hobbiton only 30 minutes drive door to door.	
3260932	50005792	It was perfect having breakfast and dinner out on the little front deck with the beautiful view of hills and farmland.		80006282	We're glad you enjoyed yourselves - warmest wishes, Robyn	
3260932	50005793	We made great use of the tv and dvd player for movie nights, and the pool was great to cool off on a hot day.				
3260932	50005794	Also the place wasn't too far from Hobbitton which was awesome!				
3260932	50005795	Overall our stay was totaly worth it				
3260932	50005796	and we had a great time.				
3260932	50005797	Thanks.				

3236719	50005800	Great Hotel Next to Everything ---SEP---		80006293	Dear Firegeek, Room 320 is one of my favorite too!	
3236719	50005801	This was my first trip to the French Quarter Inn and my second trip to Charleston.		80006294	On behalf of the entire French Quarter Inn team, we greatly appreciate your kind words about our charming hotel, and we also thank you for helping us to spread the word about our renowned services to other travelers.	
3236719	50005802	I stayed in Room 320 which had a king bed and a balcony - loved it.		80006295	Remember to ‚ÄúLike‚Äù us on Facebook to stay connected with exclusive offerings and current French Quarter Inn enhancements.	
3236719	50005803	Room was the right size and the balcony was large enough to hold a table with 4 chairs and another 2 chairs and small table (i.e. bistro set).		80006296	Please contact me directly if I can ever be of any assistance to you and your family.	
3236719	50005804	In the morning the balcony was great for waking up with coffee and in the evening you can stand at the rail and people-watch below.		80006297	We hope to see y'all again!	
3236719	50005805	The hotel seems to cover all of the details from the coffee in the morning (even on each floor), chocolates, wine/cheese, champagne to the cookies and milk in the evening.		80006298	With highest regards, Brent Gresham, General Manager French Quarter Inn	
3236719	50005806	This was the first hotel I stayed where there was a pillow concierge.				
3236719	50005807	As a cigar smoker, I was very happy that the private and public balconies had an ashtray.				
3236719	50005808	I plan to return this fall.				
3236719	50005809	Two side notes; 1.)				
3236719	50005810	the package I purchased included a carriage ride.				
3236719	50005811	The carriage does not come up to the valet area but stays in the loading zone ‚Äì look to the left of the valet entrance, and 2.)				
3236719	50005812	the valet entrance is not at 166 Church Street ‚Äì if you have a GPS , put in 74 Linguard St. .				

3288835	50005820	Modern and clean - but maybe no microwave!		80006309	Dear Chrissy D. It sounds like you truly had a blast!	
3288835	50005821	---SEP---		80006310	Thanks for sharing your experience on tripAdvisor ,cant wait to serve you again for your next visit!	
3288835	50005822	We were pleasantly surprised by the modern, airport/cruiseship-like design of this hotel.		80006311	Please let me know when you are coming back!	
3288835	50005823	Walking into the lobby and breakfast area feels like entering a funky airport lounge.		80006312	Cheers, Edna Suarez Sales and Marketing	
3288835	50005824	Very open, modern and bright design - love it!				
3288835	50005825	The double queen room was spacious and comfortable.				
3288835	50005826	Also liked the decor in the room.				
3288835	50005827	Nice stone counters and desktops, wood accents and pretty wallpaper all pulled together with a fun colour scheme.				
3288835	50005828	Everything feels and looks very new in this hotel as does the surrounding retail complexes.				
3288835	50005829	Bathroom is bright and spotless.				
3288835	50005830	I also appreciate that the counter was large enough to allow room to store toiletries for four, as well as put clothing on when changing.				
3288835	50005831	Also a big plus was the four hooks for towels behind the door!				
3288835	50005832	This is always one of my biggest gripes about hotel bathrooms - not enough places to hang more than two towels to dry.				
3288835	50005833	We try to reuse our towels for at least a couple of days, and without enough places to dry them, that's not always possible.				
3288835	50005834	One small complaint is that queen double rooms do not come with microwaves (I was told only King suites have microwaves).				
3288835	50005835	To me, this is very odd.				
3288835	50005836	I've stayed in many hotels, from 2 to 4 stars, and it was shocking to me that there was no microwave.				
3288835	50005837	There was certainly room for one, so I'm puzzled by this decision.				
3288835	50005838	Last comment - the hotel doesn't show any photos of their pool, but they do have one, and it even has an indoor/outdoor waterslide!				
3288835	50005839	Such a great feature, especially for families with kids.				
3288835	50005840	My 6 and 9 YO boys had a blast on the waterslide and splashing around in the pool.				
3288835	50005841	Overall, really enjoyed our stay here.				
3288835	50005842	Loved the convenience of good restaurants right across the street, and Superstore behind for gas and snacks.				
3288835	50005843	A good choice for anyone!				

3242261	50005850	Great overnight stay for a great price ---SEP--- Couldn't really fault this place.		80006323	Dear Tracey W W, I am delighted to have received your lovely comments, thank you very much for taking time to add your review.	
3242261	50005851	Brilliant deal of around ¬£40 for a comfy twin room, including a decent breakfast.		80006324	We hope to be able to welcome you back for another enjoyable stay in the near future.	
3242261	50005852	Room spotless with lovely sea view.		80006325	Kind Regards Marianne Slettedal	
3242261	50005853	Friendly staff, free parking and a 10 minute walk to the BIC for a gig.				
3242261	50005854	A few steps from the beach - couldn't ask for more really.				

3292105	50005860	Warm and Cosy ---SEP--- Montville Treehouses are perched among beautiful eucalypts and all sorts of different trees.		80006336	Good Morning David B.	
3292105	50005861	From the balcony, you look directly into the crowns of the trees just beside your balcony.		80006337	Many thanks for your review.	
3292105	50005862	In the evenings you'll fall asleep to a concert of frog calls and the crackle of a fire (if the wood provided isn't damp - my only quip).		80006338	We always value feedback from our guests!	
3292105	50005863	With dawn, a symphony of birdsong slowly rouses you from your slumber.		80006339	Wow, you're good with words!	
3292105	50005864	What better time than early in the morning to go for a walk to Kondalila Falls, which are accessible on foot direct from the treehouses.		80006340	You certainly evoked the feeling of Tree Houses that we wish to portray!	
3292105	50005865	Just up the road is a quirky little cafe that serves amazing brekky with beautiful views.		80006341	We're so pleased that you embraced our lovely area and our wildlife.	
3292105	50005866	This is a great place to get away and unwind.		80006342	Yes, it is lovely waking up to the sounds and the smells of the rainforest.	
3292105	50005867	It's not cheap but definitely worth the price.		80006343	The cafe up the road is called Elements and you're right - it's fabulous!	
3292105	50005868	I'll definitely return.		80006344	Thank you again	
3292105				80006345	and we very much look forward to seeing you in the future.	
3292105				80006346	Regards, Danielle	

3196464	50005870	Expected price for capital city ---SEP---		80006357	Dear Guest, Thank you for your review on your recent stay at Quest Bondi Junction.	
3196464	50005871	The room and parking prices made it excessive considering the location is not overlooking the harbour or ocean and the noise from the traffic below was very loud..		80006358	We value all of our guest feedback as it allows us the opportunity to reflect on our services and facilities so they may better meet our guest needs.	
3196464	50005872	Great for shopping and the area is well served by public transport.		80006359	Again, thank you for your valuable feedback.	
3196464				80006360	We hope to welcome you back again at Quest Bondi Junction in the near future.	
3196464				80006361	Kind Regards, Karan Anand Property Manager	

3299750	50005880	Taken!		80006372	Aloha, Mahalo for your review and for staying at the Moana Surfrider, A Westin Resort & Spa.	
3299750	50005881	---SEP---		80006373	We would like to sincerely apologize for the concerns mentioned regarding your assigned suite.	
3299750	50005882	My wife and recently flew to Oahu to celebrate a friends 50th.		80006374	Cleanliness is one of our top priorities for our guests and am disappointed to hear this was not the case during your stay.	
3299750	50005883	Our friends live on the Island and after four days with them I surprised my wife with a night in Honolulu.		80006375	Your review has been shared with our management team.	
3299750	50005884	Having visited the Moana Surfrider in the past I knew it was the only hotel that could support a great afternoon and evening in the chaos they call Waikiki.		80006376	We would like to investigate this situation more, if you could kindly provide us with the details of your stay with your room number to 374guestexperienceteam@westin.com.	
3299750	50005885	While the lobby bar and staff were what I've come to expect at a Westin the Suite I had reserved was NOT.		80006377	Thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns with us.	
3299750	50005886	When we arrived to our suite I was surprised to see how dated and beat up the furniture was.				
3299750	50005887	There was no mini bar, no way to plug in an I-device for listening to music and the only music available was pay per listen on the TV.				
3299750	50005888	I could swallow all that for the price tag but what I wasn't able to swallow was the cleanliness of this room.				
3299750	50005889	The couch had stains all over it as did the lampshades.				
3299750	50005890	It was disgusting.				
3299750	50005891	On top of that the shower leaked out onto the bedroom carpet.				
3299750	50005892	I immediately alerted staff and while I didn't want to cause a big commotion I thought they could clean it up a bit while we were out to dinner.				
3299750	50005893	As it happens the house cleaning showed up at 9:40pm to clean the room, my wife was already asleep.				
3299750	50005894	Continued emails to the hotel manager, Mr. Anderson, that have so far gone unanswered				
3299750	50005895	and I waited to post on Trip Advisor to let them try and reconcile or at least address the issues.				
3299750	50005896	Nothing.				
3299750	50005897	There is no question that the hotel is the grand dame of arguably the tackiest beach scene in the Western Hemisphere.				
3299750	50005898	That said, I think the operators have taken that a little too seriously in their choice d√©cor an lack of cleanliness.				
3299750	50005899	I will not stay at this hotel again and will look very hard at any future stays with Westin.				

3194850	50005900	Clean and Convenient ---SEP---		80006388	Dear Laurie E, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback of your time with us.	
3194850	50005901	The hotel was clean and the staff was efficient.		80006389	We take great pride in providing our guests with an elevated experience and are glad to know that you experienced that.	
3194850	50005902	The location was very convenient and close to Mall and many dining options.		80006390	We hope to see you again soon!	
3194850	50005903	Self parking was in attached garage and parking lot gets very full during the day, but we had no issues with it.				

3274925	50005910	Great Stay ---SEP---		80006401	Dear Trish H, Thank you so much for your insightful review.	
3274925	50005911	We stayed last August for a convention.		80006402	I understand that there are many travel options when visiting this city	
3274925	50005912	We stayed in a Bella Suite which was large and very nice (totally recommend) and had access to the club which served breakfast and appetizers/cocktails at night.		80006403	and I sincerely appreciate and thank you for choosing The Palazzo to host you during your most recent visit.	
3274925	50005913	Great stay and our room was very clean and was always made up promptly.		80006404	Kind regards, Roi Ebalo Hotel Manager ‚Äì Guest Relations	
3274925	50005914	Check in was quick and easy as we went up to the club level to check in which is on the same floor as the lounge and we were treated to champagne as we filled out the paperwork.				
3274925	50005915	Room service was prompt and great too.				
3274925	50005916	Lots of restaurants to choose plus Caesars Forum Shops are across street for more restaurants and shopping.				
3274925	50005917	You are able to freely go from the Venetian to the Palazzo and charge to your room as they are sister properties.				
3274925	50005918	If you are going there for the pool, the pool is not large like some of the resorts but if you like pools that are intimate you will like this very much.				
3274925	50005919	Highly recommended!				

3193828	50005920	nice clean hotel to stay overnight ---SEP---		80006415	Dear anitaIB671RC, Thank you for staying with us and I'm glad to hear that you've enjoyed our new equipment at the gym.	
3193828	50005921	This hotel is at an excellent location on Nanaimo harbour front.		80006416	Will look forward to welcoming you again!	
3193828	50005922	It has a nice view overlooking the harbour and is close to all restaurants and shops.		80006417	Sincerely, Julie Park General Manager BEST WESTERN Dorchester Hotel	
3193828	50005923	Rooms are clean and it was a pleasant surprise to see all new equipments at the gym.				

3237853	50005930	Love the Aloft Denver!		80006428	Thank you for reaching out and sharing the kind words about our hotel and location.	
3237853	50005931	---SEP--- Had a trade show at convention center and Aloft couldn‚Äôt have been more convenient.		80006429	We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay!	
3237853	50005932	Very nice space, comfy room and great staff.		80006430	We really appreciate the feedback about the bathroom and will use it in the future to make improvements to our hotel.	
3237853	50005933	Bathroom is a bit tight, but otherwise very lovely property.		80006431	It was great to see you and we hope to welcome you back, soon.	
3237853	50005934	Highly recommend Aloft!				

3189418	50005940	Very pleased with stay ---SEP---		80006442	Dear Reviewer, Thanks so much for your great feedback about the Old Ship.	
3189418	50005941	I stayed at this hotel many years ago and really loved it.		80006443	You are right, the location is just perfect.	
3189418	50005942	After reading some recent reviews I was a little nervous to return but I am glad I trusted my insticts as I ended up having a great night stay there.		80006444	Just a stones throw from the Pier and a 2 minute walk from The Lanes - it really couldn't be a better spot!	
3189418	50005943	Location is perfect, right opposite the beach and pier.		80006445	Its great to hear you are a return visiter - dont leave it too long before you come and see us again!	
3189418	50005944	Even nicer room than I expected, large modern bathroom and huge TV in room.		80006446	Regards Claire

3220125	50005982	Breakfast was fine but there were no trays to collect the food I asked and was told they had been taken away which I find strange because this is not the policy in other holiday inns I was impressed with the layout of this hotel the rooms were large with flat screen TVs and the breakfast area was good, and with helpful staff well done to the Manager		80006501	Thank you again for your comments

3258756	50006011	We stayed at this hotel a couple of times before and when needing a room before our cruise we of course went back.		80006531	We work very hard to ensure our facilities and service are superior.

3258756	50006015	The next morning we had a super beakfast, good variety and great coffee.				
3258756	50006016	Most impressive was how hard the manager worked at cleaning tables, sweeping floors, picking up and making small talk with guests.				
3258756	50006017	Transportation by shuttle to the cruise terminal was very well organized with two departures in the morning.				
3258756	50006018	We were very impressed by the overall attention to detail and cleanliness of this hotel and will be back for sure when our travels take us back to beautiful Fort Lauderdale.

3218283	50006050	Rooms ---SEP---		80006586	Dear unknown107, Thank you for your review and for staying with us recently.	
3218283	50006051	The room originally assigned to us was so small you could not turn around.		80006587	We certainly want all of our guests to be comfortable and enjoy our luxurious amenities.	
3218283	50006052	The bed was behind a wall with only the bed and a large screen television.		80006588	All of our rooms are standard if not larger than comparable hotel rooms in downtown Chicago.	
3218283	50006053	We asked for a different room.		80006589	We're happy we were able to switch your room and we would be happy in the future to adjust any temperature needs for you as well.	
3218283	50006054	For an additional $35 we got a room with a direct view of the Trump name on the hotel across the street.		80006590	Thanks unknown107.	
3218283	50006055	The room was noisy and the air conditioner blew air directly on the bed.

3182622	50006061	The hotel was undergoing some sort of construction.		80006602	We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that was caused.	
3182622	50006062	There were huge noisy fans running all night.		80006603	We certainly appreciate your comments and we hope you will choose us again when you visit Ft.	
3182622	50006063	Horrible smell in the halls .		80006604	Lauderdale	
3182622	50006064	I was not told about this when I checked in.				
3182622	50006065	Only discovered it when I got to the floor/room.				
3182622	50006066	I would have switched hotels if I could have.				
3182622	50006067	Only one out of three elevators worked.				
3182622	50006068	Staff was the only nice part.				
3182622	50006069	The staff was super friendly.

3258999	50006101	I have stayed at the Sheraton for business trips from the U.S. three times and will be staying multiple nights over the next few weeks.		80006648	Thank you also for your patience during our recent lobby and Sheraton bar renovations, which are now fully accessible to all guests.	
3258999	50006102	The staff is amazing and always goes beyond to help with directions, recommendations, and arranging transportation.		80006649	We are receiving super feedback on the works carried out and look forward to completing all works with the final phase at the end of August.	
3258999	50006103	The breakfast buffet offers a variety and helps to get the day started.		80006650	Thankfully these works will have less impact on our guests.	
3258999	50006104	The rooms are well appointed and roomy.		80006651	Both the team and I look forward to welcoming you back with us on your next visit.	
3258999	50006105	While I was there they were renovating the lobby, but it had no impact on my stay.		80006652	Kind regards, Garrett McGuinness General Manager	
3258999	50006106	It was a little loud when I arrived, but the hotel rooms are not located in the same area.				

3273863	50006110	Great Sleep ---SEP---		80006663	Hello 976meganj, Thank you for letting us know about your stay at our Hampton!	
3273863	50006111	This is a clean hotel with very comfortable beds.		80006664	We look forward to welcoming you back to Saskatoon in the near future.	
3273863	50006112	The front desk staff had trouble checking me in.		80006665	Sincerely, Nini	
3273863	50006113	It was very busy with sports teams but still quiet.				
3273863	50006114	The breakfast was not the greatest and the coffee could use an overhaul.				
3273863	50006115	But overall a decent stay				

3253465	50006120	Near Busch Gardens ---SEP---		80006676	Thank you for your comments as we greatly appreciate them.	
3253465	50006121	The hotel is being updated.		80006677	We look forward to your next visit.	
3253465	50006122	We had a room tight off the pool where they played 80's music from 8 am to at least 10 pm.				
3253465	50006123	Couldn't really hear it in the room.				
3253465	50006124	Really liked how we had two TVs and a separate room with couch to hang.				
3253465	50006125	Once updated it should be nicer.				

3228451	50006130	A perfect place to start ---SEP---		80006688	Thank-you for choosing Sovereign Park during your stay in Ballarat.	
3228451	50006131	This Motel was the first of our accommodation choices in Victoria and we were not disappointed.		80006689	I'm glad you enjoyed all of our facilities on offer here including our wonderful restaurant next door, our refurbished bathrooms.	
3228451	50006132	Our room was generous in size and the modernised furnishings and luxury renovated bathroom fabulous.		80006690	We get many comments about our pillows and I'm glad you noticed the difference with ours.	
3228451	50006133	The pillows for a fussy sleeper a great combination of firm and fluffy as opposed to the usual marshmallow others seem to think is adequate.		80006691	We look forward to welcoming you back to stay with us.	
3228451	50006134	The attached restaurant a delightful and delicious bonus Would happily stay again.				

3176527	50006140	Great stay ---SEP---		80006702	I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time out to review our hotel and staff members.	
3176527	50006141	Our room was clean and nicely decorated.		80006703	We work very hard to provide and exceptional guest experience for each guest and it is nice to see that hard work paying off.	
3176527	50006142	The staff was friendly and helpful and the price was great.		80006704	I will be sharing your review with the staff members.	
3176527	50006143	The location is great, being just off the strip so you can get to everything quickly, but it isn't so close you are right in the middle of all the activity.		80006705	I thank you so much for the recommendations to others!	
3176527	50006144	I would most definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.		80006706	We look forward to providing you with the same excellent experience in the future.	

3280849	50006150	Would love to have stayed longer... ---SEP---		80006717	Hi there in the UK.	
3280849	50006151	Despite our late arrival in Prince George we were met at the Skeena Train station by a welcoming Peter who drove us to the B&B. Julie greeted us warmly, showed us round and checked breakfast requirements.		80006718	Thank you for your review!	
3280849	50006152	Our accommodation exceeded our expectations.		80006719	It was a pleasure to meet you ( albeit a short stay) and glad you enjoyed our hospitality.	
3280849	50006153	It was spacious - in addition to our bedroom and bathroom we had use of a guests' well equipped kitchenette, lounge/dining room with log effect fire, TV and WiFi connection.				
3280849	50006154	A variety of books and reading material, pictures and stitch-work gave just the right amount of personal touch.				
3280849	50006155	Breakfast was home-made, healthy, delicious and plentiful.				
3280849	50006156	Peter and Julie were enthusiastic and knowledgeable promoters of Prince George and surrounding area and it is such a shame we couldn't stay longer to take advantage of this and of their hospitality.				
3280849	50006157	We had a very comfortable night's sleep and our short stay could not have been better.				
3280849	50006158	Peter took us back to the Skeena station after breakfast.				

3181445	50006160	Not what we had expected ---SEP--- First thing to mention is that we were traveling with our tiny Yorkie so we were in a pet friendly room.		80006720	Thank you for your comments and I apologize that your pet room was not in order.	
3181445	50006161	The first room that we were in smelled so bad that we asked to be moved.		80006721	We only have a few designated pet rooms to accommodate guest with pets and you are correct as they do require constant attention to the carpet and bedding.	
3181445	50006162	They obliged and the second room was better but not great.		80006722	I apologize your room was not up to our standards.	
3181445	50006163	Secondly the only area for pets to relieve themselves was at the top of a hill.		80006723	Sorry about the grass and your poor puppy in the jungle, with all the rain it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to keep up with.	
3181445	50006164	Had to climb up the hill to an area where the grass has not been mowed recently and our small 7 pound dog did not like to go in grass up to his ears.		80006724	We hope you‚Äôll give us another chance to make a better impression upon you someday, please contact me and I‚Äôll be happy to help.	
3181445	50006165	They charge $15 per night extra for the pet		80006725	Sincerely, Jay Wilson General Manager 417-231-4669	
3181445	50006166	so I would have thought that the rooms would have been kept cleaner.				
3181445	50006167	The free breakfast every morning was so so, nothing to write home about.				
3181445	50006168	Overall I will check another motel hotel first before going back to this one.				

3285857	50006170	Family Wedding ---SEP---		80006736	Thank you for sharing your review with us.	
3285857	50006171	Very disappointed in this hotel.		80006737	We apologise that you did not enjoy your time with us.	
3285857	50006172	Very short staffed (nice people though).		80006738	We strive to make every guest's experience a great one	
3285857	50006173	The front desk person was also the breakfast person, and the customer service person ie if needing towels etc.		80006739	but it appears we missed the mark on your stay.	
3285857	50006174	one day the bed was not even made or towels replaced even though we were out all day.		80006740	Once again, please accept our apologies and thank you again for sharing your thoughts with us.	
3285857	50006175	It's a downtown location but no stores, decent restaurants around this area apparently everything in New Sudbury nice hotels, restaurants and shopping malls .				
3285857	50006176	The Fitness room was dilapidated treadmill and bike were not usable, mats were very dirty.				
3285857	50006177	The hotel is older and run down making it look dirty even though there was cleaning happening.				
3285857	50006178	We used Airmiles to pay for our 3 night stay but it was a waste of points.				

3205313	50006180	One night stop over ---SEP--- When visiting Cardiff to go to a concert we decided to stay over for one night we wanted somewhere close to the St Davids Hall in the city centre and to be honest the Holiday Inn was the only hotel with a vacancy for the date we required at such short notice, how fortunate we were.		80006751	Dear Chris N Thank you so much for your review and for choosing to stay with us recently whilst attending a concert in the city.	
3205313	50006181	The room was more than adequate, spotlessly clean and with all the amenities that one would need.		80006752	I am glad that all the facilities were to your liking, and the team made that lasting positive impression.	
3205313	50006182	Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice with many healthy choices as well as the great British full English and the staff were very polite and helpful.		80006753	I do hope that we have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future.	
3205313	50006183	This hotel is not the cheapest I have stayed in but I still felt it was good value for money and it's situation is perfect for the city centre.		80006754	Kind regards Richard Platts General Manager	

3271704	50006190	We got there in the end.		80006765	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at the Novotel Glasgow Centre.	
3271704	50006191	---SEP---		80006766	I am sorry that your experience did not meet your expectations; please allow me to express my sincerest apologies.	
3271704	50006192	So, upon arrival (1 hour after check in time) we were presented with a member of staff who didn't really seem bothered that our room wasn't ready and essentially, thats that.		80006767	At Novotel, we strive to provide a superior service experience for every customer; therefore your feedback is very important to us.	
3271704	50006193	Naturally, this wasn't acceptable.		80006768	Please rest assured that we are taking the appropriate measures to address the problem and prevent future occurrence.	
3271704	50006194	I would have been happy with just another standard room but another staff member noted to him and we got upgraded to superior - Nice...not.		80006769	I did send you an email directly with a compensation offer and i'am looking forward to your response.	
3271704	50006195	The superior room was dirty with various stains; Including on the chair, carpet, mattress protector and light switches.		80006770	We appreciate your sharing your concerns, and it is our hope that you will give us the opportunity to better serve you in the near future.	
3271704	50006196	By this point, I was a bit defeated as this was Hogmanay!		80006771	Regards, Karine Girard	
3271704	50006197	We went back down and noted; this is where there is a 180.				
3271704	50006198	Member of staff Marta handled it with the utmost perfection.				
3271704	50006199	She was literally the saving grace of the day and with her fantastic customer service skills and to be honest, just lovely personality, we were sorted and into a clean room!				
3271704	50006200	There was an empty bottle of whisky in the cupboard...				
3271704	50006201	but I found that rather amusing, someone had a good night, a-ha!				
3271704	50006202	I'd like to note to management that Marta really is a credit to the hotel!				
3271704	50006203	From there on the staff were wonderful as we explored the hotel more.				
3271704	50006204	The shower/bathrooms are brilliant!				
3271704	50006205	Really the highlight and best points of the rooms.				
3271704	50006206	The difference between rooms seems to be the amenities only.				
3271704	50006207	As the decor/layout seemed to be the same throughout the rooms we saw.				
3271704	50006208	Overall, it was a good stay, brilliant evening and a decent sleep.				
3271704	50006209	A little bump in the road to get there, but once there it was a steady pace!				

3256055	50006210	Amazing wedding at the Long Beach Lodge ---SEP---		80006782	Congratulations on your wedding, I wish you both a long and happy life together.	
3256055	50006211	Scott and I were married at the Long Beach Lodge on April 15, 2014.		80006783	Thank you for your nice comments regarding Megan.	
3256055	50006212	We could not have asked for a better day!		80006784	She does an awesome job, and goes the extra distance to make sure that everyone's wedding day is extra special.	
3256055	50006213	It was magical at the Long Beach Lodge and everything went perfectly.		80006785	We look forward to you coming back to celebrate an anniversary.	
3256055	50006214	I have been emailing the Events Coordinator Megan weekly for almost a year and throughout the whole process she was a gem!		80006786	Tim Hackett	
3256055	50006215	She was always quick to respond to my emails and rolled with whatever challenges came her way.				
3256055	50006216	We changed from an elopement wedding to an intimate wedding and back several times and Megan was always gracious and more then happy to accommodate our wishes.				
3256055	50006217	The day of the wedding was perfect, Megan set up the table beautifully and had a gorgeous wedding cake for us which was a total surprise.				
3256055	50006218	She coordinated the day so well I didn't have to worry about anything but looking great.				
3256055	50006219	I would highly recommend the Long Beach Lodge to anyone wanting to get married in Tofino - you won't be disappointed.				
3256055	50006220	Our photographer, Karley Bracey, was great in helping us get unique, beautiful, and dramatic photos around the Lodge, on the beach, on the rocks, and in the forest.				
3256055	50006221	Mark from On The Beach video in Tofino was also phenomenal in capturing our special day.				
3256055	50006222	I'm so grateful that we had an outstanding team to help us make this day perfect and now we have lasting memories.				
3256055	50006223	THANK YOU MEGAN and all the wonderful staff at the Long Beach Lodge, we'll be coming back for years to come.				

3264813	50006230	Great relaxing weekend ---SEP---		80006797	Dear Daddyblogger1 Thank you for taking the time to post a review on your recent family holiday at Lake Crackenback Resort & Spa - we love hearing from our guests.	
3264813	50006231	I visited the resort with my wife and 3 kids (10, 7 and 2 years) for a long weekend in March (autumn).		80006798	We are so pleased to have played a part in making your holiday so enjoyable.	
3264813	50006232	We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment overlooking the lake it was very spacious.		80006799	The three bedroom lake view apartments are perfect for families and we are so glad you found them to be spacious and well equipped with everything you need.	
3264813	50006233	The rooms were large, with great heating facilities, and comfortable beds.		80006800	Autumn is a perfect time to visit the Snowy Mountains and here at the resort we ensure we continually value add to the experience with lots of activities and it sound as though you and your family made the most of your time here.	
3264813	50006234	The dining area and kitchen was well appointed.		80006801	We are also very conscious of providing many activities on a complimentary basis to ensure all of our guests have excellent value for money with their stay here.	
3264813	50006235	There are loads of activities (free and paid for).		80006802	Again, apologies for the length of service at Alpine Larder, this has been addressed and we appreciate you bringing it to our attention.	
3264813	50006236	We rented bikes for everyone - including one adult bike with a kid carrier for my 2 year old.		80006803	We look forward to welcoming you and your family back when next visiting from Canberra and in the meantime invite you to join us on Facebook where we regularly provide updates on packages, special events and happenings here at the resort.	
3264813	50006237	There are loads of bike tracks - even ones that are suitable for kids.		80006804	Kind regards The team at Lake Crackenback Resort & Spa	
3264813	50006238	I highly recommend the one that goes all the way around the resort and takes approx 20 minutes but we were all able to do it easily.				
3264813	50006239	There is also a kids mountain bike training area which my kids loved.				
3264813	50006240	There are trampolines, tennis courts, archery, boating etc - all at no cost.				
3264813	50006241	Breakfast buffet at Cuisine is predictable but good.				
3264813	50006242	The food is constantly refilled and there are a number of coffee machines around.				
3264813	50006243	We had lunch at the Alpine Larder and service was incredibly slow (on both days) and the pizzas aren't that big.				
3264813	50006244	We needed 3 pizzas for our family of 5.				
3264813	50006245	Overall a fantastic weekend away.				

3196623	50006250	Hotel overpriced ---SEP---		80006815	Aloha Jaime, Thank you for your feedback.	
3196623	50006251	Rooms are dingy breakfast consists of granola bars and fruit which isn't included in your bill.		80006816	We're very sorry to hear that your stay with us did not meet expectations.	
3196623	50006252	I will not be going back.		80006817	We are currently undergoing a renovation but I will still be sharing your feedback with our management team as we never want a guest to leave feeling the way you do.	
3196623	50006253	I heard several complaints while I was there about TV remotes missing, wifi not working		80006818	We do hope that you will give us a second chance once our renovation is complete.	
3196623				80006819	Mahalo, Tom Kloss General Manager Stay Hotel Waikiki	

3250189	50006260	New Favorite Hotel!		80006820	Dear Sarah M, What a glowing review!	
3250189	50006261	---SEP---		80006821	You make me so proud our Marshall House team.	
3250189	50006262	The Marshall House is such a gem, and was our favorite part of our stay in Savannah.		80006822	Olivia is a great breakfast host, and she really enjoys making her quiche!	
3250189	50006263	The room was so comfortable and clean, and absolutely gorgeous.		80006823	I will make sure to pass along your compliments.	
3250189	50006264	The hotel's history is evident in every room and hallway, but everything felt clean and updated at the same time--it was the best of both worlds!		80006824	As far as the hauntings, the Marshall House was just nominated by USA Today for the honor of the Best Haunted Hotel in the U.S.	
3250189	50006265	The staff were all incredibly friendly, and breakfast was delicious (the quiche florentine was so good, I had two helpings every morning!).		80006825	"The emphasis is on ""The Best"" not ""The Most."""	
3250189	50006266	The hotel's location is also ideal for walking around downtown Savannah!		80006826	I try to stay clear of the debates, and focus on leading this team to be the Best.	
3250189	50006267	We were always close to good restaurants, shopping, and activities.		80006827	Your review gives us great satisfaction and we can't thank you enough!	
3250189	50006268	We even did a ghost trolley tour that picked us up right from the Marshall House itself!		80006828	Happy Travels, Hugh	
3250189	50006269	As for the property being haunted, I can't really say!				
3250189	50006270	We didn't experience a single strange thing.				
3250189	50006271	In fact, the three nights we had at the Marshall House were our best nights of sleep (the beds are really comfy)!				
3250189	50006272	However, locals were quick to tell us the place was super haunted.				
3250189	50006273	I was perfectly okay with not being scared by anything, however ;)				
3250189	50006274	We stayed on the second floor, room 220, which was toward the back and while we didn't have a great view, it was a very quiet room, so ideal if you want to stay away from street noise!!				

3248221	50006280	Top quality stay ---SEP---		80006839	Thanks for your review.	
3248221	50006281	This is a beautifully decorated old building with every need catered for.		80006840	Obviously, you and your husband are fans of our food offerings!	
3248221	50006282	The facilities and food and little extra touches are second to none.		80006841	We look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3248221	50006283	Even a gluten free biscuit left for me in the bedroom once they found out that I couldn't eat wheat.				
3248221	50006284	Chocolates, water, toiletries and tea making all provided in the bedroom.				
3248221	50006285	The bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes for breakfast were wonderful as was the selection of really fresh fruit.				
3248221	50006286	My husband said the fried eggs were excellent.				
3248221	50006287	I also enjoyed the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.				
3248221	50006288	Everything freshly cooked to perfection.				
3248221	50006289	Well worth a visit and we would definitely book again if visiting that area.				

3173275	50006290	Ecstatic in a static ---SEP--- Booking online		80006852	Dear Guest, Thank you for your review.	
3173275	50006291	I had booked online for a static in the meadow however they rang within an hour of taking the booking and offered a Gwithian three bedroom as the meadow was fully booked.		80006853	We are glad that you had a good time, overall.	
3173275	50006292	Which was disappointing.		80006854	Sorry that the Meadow Lodge was not available.	
3173275	50006293	Checking in was reasonably quick and friendly.		80006855	We do have a security number that you can call if it is noisy.	
3173275	50006294	The caravan was clean and tidy.		80006856	We hope to see you again.	
3173275	50006295	The pool is a fantastic facility and the lifeguards were friendly and very attentive.				
3173275	50006296	The entertainment was not really our thing.				
3173275	50006297	So can't really comment.				
3173275	50006298	The playing field at the top is lovely and nice and large for playing frisbee.				
3173275	50006299	"The children's view was ""it's like a small centre parcs"" We did have noisy all male neighbours who were chatting at 3:00 am one night which wasn't great."				
3173275	50006300	But it was a one off other than that quiet.				
3173275	50006301	The shop is ok a bit pricey but there is a morrisons a short drive away.				
3173275	50006302	It's a short drive to Newquay and the beaches which was ideal.				
3173275	50006303	We would come back again, however I would definitely pay the extra and go for the meadow.				
3173275	50006304	We went and had a look at them and they were nicer larger plots.				

3241927	50006310	Fabulous ---SEP---		80006867	Dear Guest, The continued return of a loyal guest is the highest honor that we can earn and I thank you for bestowing this upon The Venetian |	
3241927	50006311	We stayed 4 nights in the standard room which included a beautiful view of the Wynn golf course.		80006868	The Palazzo.	
3241927	50006312	Our room was clean and had no problems at all.		80006869	Thank you for your feedback and continued loyalty.	
3241927	50006313	The casino, entertainment, restaurants, and attractions were all top notch.		80006870	I look forward to exceeding your expectations for many trips to come.	
3241927	50006314	All the staff were friendly.		80006871	Kind Regards, Kirsten Dimond VP of Hotel Operations	
3241927	50006315	I plan on going back to Vegas again this winter and wouldn't hesitate on staying at the palazzo again.				

3286763	50006320	Great hotel, great staff ---SEP--- Very accommodating staff, prob the friendliest and most accommodating staff I‚Äôve experienced at a 5-star hotel.		80006882	Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us here.

3184419	50006332	Our room accomodations were great.				
3184419	50006333	The room was clean and we also had an adjouring room with our room which was just perfect for my 14 yr old daughter.				
3184419	50006334	Everyone who works their the clerks and maids are just wonderful people.				
3184419	50006335	It was just great how well the maids kept the room and hotel clean.				
3184419	50006336	It was very nice to step out of your room into the hallway every morning and smell the fresh and clean scent in the air in the hallway and on the elevator.				
3184419	50006337	My wife got hooked on the lemon water that was provided everyday and night.				
3184419	50006338	The continental breakfast was also nice.				
3184419	50006339	I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm ever in the area.				

3165581	50006340	Quick but pleasant stay ---SEP--- Stayed here for 1 night recently with the family ( 2 adults, 3 kids).		80006907	Dear pat g, Thank you for your lovely review of your recent stay with us.	
3165581	50006341	We got a family room which was one of the best we have been in as it had 4 real beds, enough for everyone to sleep comfortably.		80006908	I was very happy to read that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us.	
3165581	50006342	It was on the ground floor and away from any noise so ideal for us.		80006909	Our pool in quite small	
3165581	50006343	We ate in the quench bar and the food was good without being spectacular.		80006910	but we do try and counteract this by having dedicated kids pool time to try and avoid overcrowding in the pool area.	
3165581	50006344	You could see issues with service on other tables with food being late etc.		80006911	We do also offer an extensive kids club program with a huge variety of activities including archery , horse riding, zorbing to name but a few.	
3165581	50006345	but we found the service good.		80006912	We have tennis courts and a soccer pitch on the grounds to keep our younger guests entertained.	
3165581	50006346	Under 12s eat free if you stay overnight which was an unexpected surprise and had never come across that before.		80006913	We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to the hotel in the very near future.	
3165581	50006347	Saved us ‚Ç¨40 so a nice extra to get.		80006914	Kind Regards Eoin Chambers	
3165581	50006348	All in all I would recommend this hotel and we would be happy to stay again.				
3165581	50006349	Staff were friendly and welcoming.				
3165581	50006350	On arrival our room wasn't ready so they gave us complimentary drinks while we waited.				
3165581	50006351	It's the little touches that make a stay that bit more pleasant.				
3165581	50006352	The breakfast buffet was great as well with plenty of choice.				
3165581	50006353	My only gripe is the pool, it's a pathetic 10m long				
3165581	50006354	so I wouldn't plan on spending a lot of time here.				

3181198	50006360	LATaveler ---SEP---		80006925	Aloha J625WSdonalds, Mahalo for joining us for your getaway in Waikiki!	
3181198	50006361	It is a nice hotel for the price with a goo location to beach etc.		80006926	As you discovered, our location and value can't be beat, and we love knowing that you will remember us the next time you're in our sunny city.	
3181198	50006362	The staff was all very nice to deal with.		80006927	Mahalo, Guest Services Manager	
3181198	50006363	The hotel rooms are fairly small but ok for a single traveler like me.				
3181198	50006364	You cannot beat the price on the location being one block from the beach.

3323804	50006382	The staff were great (as always), but the fact that one of the lifts was out of order made for lengthy delays in getting to and from your room.		80006954	We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!	
3323804	50006383	There were many older guests who found this an issue.

3275264	50006420	Lovely ---SEP--- Stayed here October 2011 for two nights as part of a road trip.		80007008	Hi Bridge1978, Thank you for your review, we are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3275264	50006421	It's opposite Flynns beach and has 3 lovely pools.		80007009	We agree that we do have the best location in Port Macquarie.	
3275264	50006422	The apartment was on the smaller side but very clean and comfortable.		80007010	Flynns Beach is the nicest one around.	
3275264	50006423	Very good location, just up the road from cafes, restaurants and general store.		80007011	Sorry to hear you felt the apartment was small, we don't ever really get that complaint.	
3275264	50006424	Easy drive from many beautiful beaches.		80007012	Very happy to hear you found it clean and comfortable though.	
3275264				80007013	Hopefully we will see you on your next road trip.	
3275264				80007014	Take care, David	

3213787	50006430	Thiefs and Poor customer service ---SEP---		80007025	Please accept my sincere apology for the misunderstanding of the parking charge during your recent visiti to the hotel.	
3213787	50006431	The room and location was decent, but that's it.		80007026	I will makie every attempt to locate the charge that you are referring to and will be glad to remove the charge from your credit card if that was how the charge was settled.	
3213787	50006432	The rate was outrageous, and the hotel charged me for parking after giving me a parking voucher that was suppose to waive the fee.		80007027	Once again please accept my apology and I will attempt to locate the charge and refund the charge.	
3213787	50006433	Bad Customer service				

3226608	50006440	Another great stay ---SEP--- Easy booking-great location-friendly professional staff-Damian booked us in-room clean and comfortable.		80007038	Thank you so much for your feedback.	
3226608	50006441	We will definitely return to the Nadler when in Liverpool-lovely atmosphere in Liverpool but good soundproofing in rooms		80007039	I am delighted that you enjoyed your stay and we hope that we can welcome you back in the near future.	
3226608				80007040	Best regards Sharon	

3322197	50006450	Great staff and excellent customer attendance!		80007051	Dear Peter, Thank you so much for acknowledging The Bloomsbury and especially Vasco.	
3322197	50006451	Beautiful Hotel ---SEP--- I've been in this hotel last month on a business trip.		80007052	He was delighted that you were happy with the excellent service he provides and does like his soccer, though we call it football down here.	
3322197	50006452	I'm glad they chose this hotel!		80007053	We would all love to see you here again soon and please do not hesitate to contact me if you are indeed planning another trip to London.	
3322197	50006453	Starting with the doorman, Vasco!		80007054	Kind regards, Sebastian Annandale Guest Relations Manager	
3322197	50006454	He had this amazing atittude, a very nice approach and loves soccer just like me!!				
3322197	50006455	Then the room was amazing!!!				
3322197	50006456	Much more than i expected!				
3322197	50006457	The service was great and I had a great time!				
3322197	50006458	Congratulations to the whole team!!				
3322197	50006459	The place is great and the neighbourhood aswell.				
3322197	50006460	Thank you for the amazing service.				
3322197	50006461	I recommend this Hotel!				

3210023	50006470	Loved The Place ---SEP---		80007065	Thank you for your kind review of Bush Village.	
3210023	50006471	We loved Bush Village; the cabins are all you need for a good nights sleep, and such good value.		80007066	We are happy you enjoyed your stay with us and would welcome you back any time.	
3210023	50006472	The bed was comfortable and the cabin and bathroom clean.		80007067	The bird life here is very special to us and we enjoy our guests reactions to the crazy Lorrikeets.	
3210023	50006473	It is set in a lush tree lined area yet it is about three hundred yards from the coast and the nice boardwalk, and about five minutes drive to Airlie Beach.		80007068	We are happy you enjoyed our location with the parklands, boardwalk and water just across the road and also our close proximity to the local shopping centre.	
3210023	50006474	There are is a shopping complex five minutes walk away, Coles ect.		80007069	The center of Airlie Beach is only a few minutes drive or a relaxing walk along the boardwalk.	
3210023	50006475	and several restaurants are nearby.		80007070	Thanks again for your review, happy travelling.	
3210023	50006476	We found the owner/ manager, Bryan, very helpful, friendly, and easy going.				
3210023	50006477	He really comes across as wanting you to enjoy your stay.				
3210023	50006478	It even has a nice little swimming pool.				
3210023	50006479	It‚Äôs a great value gem, especially if you like parrots; they are everywhere, and such fun to watch.				
3210023	50006480	We stayed four nights as we were based in Cairns and had driven down to see The Whitsundays, I could have stayed longer, and if I went back I would stay at Bush Village again.				

3253560	50006490	Average hotel; less than average Management ---SEP--- Stayed here before when they had a biker group from the Philippines staying here.		80007081	Dear noeffnscreenname, Thank you for your honest review regarding your stay at our hotel.	
3253560	50006491	they were a large group and took over the breakfast room pretty effectively.		80007082	We are very sorry about the inconvenience that you faced during your time with us.	
3253560	50006492	Worse this time.		80007083	Please know that your concerns have been addressed to our staff and are taken very seriously.	
3253560	50006493	Trevor Bain wants you to think that he is the Mgr on duty; but he is not; he is at home.		80007084	We are thrilled that you highlighted an employee that you thought was working very determinedly and efficiently.	
3253560	50006494	I tried calling about 7PM to confirm that I was coming but after literally a dozen tries going to a recording after the second ring, I gave up.		80007085	Our goal as a hotel is to wow all of our guests and are disappointed that we missed that opportunity with you.	
3253560	50006495	Got here about 8 and the front desk was mobbed.		80007086	We hope that you would be so kind as to give us another chance and stay with us again, in the future.	
3253560	50006496	Which is why they weren't answering the phone.		80007087	Once more, thank you for reviewing our hotel.	
3253560	50006497	Only one lady behind the desk, Gabriella.				
3253560	50006498	More about her later.				
3253560	50006499	Guy comes down and has not had his room serviced and there were no towels.				
3253560	50006500	My reservation thru the Baymont website that was guaranteed on my credit card because I made it too late to cancel is on record but it is not run on my cc and it is cancellable and they are out of King rooms as was my reservation.				
3253560	50006501	The only good thing is that the rate that they are offering is less than the reserve online.				
3253560	50006502	Get to the room and the e-key does not open the room.				
3253560	50006503	Go back down and get new card plus an extra and this time one of the keys opens the room.				
3253560	50006504	Go down to business center to print boarding pass and their printer doesn't work but they will print as the front desk.				
3253560	50006505	But their connection and computers are running dog slow.				
3253560	50006506	Back to Gabriella.				
3253560	50006507	This girl was young but she knew her stuff.				
3253560	50006508	She was moving at a pace that you never see from an employee - determined.				
3253560	50006509	She operated with purpose and knew every trick to keep things moving.				
3253560	50006510	While folks were signing in she darted to the back and got the guy his towels without missing a beat.				
3253560	50006511	This girl deserves the Manager's salary and job.				
3253560	50006512	I was reminded of the Sergeant Major in Black hawk down that was leading his convoy in to pickup the Marines from the downed chopper, bullets, rockets and grenades flying everywhere				
3253560	50006513	but he didn't dodge, duck, show concern, change course or nothing but just kept everybody moving forward.				
3253560	50006514	That was this girl.				
3253560	50006515	Completely unflustered and still courteous.				
3253560	50006516	Baymont, take a friggin hint.				
3253560	50006517	Do your job.				
3253560	50006518	That being hotel management.				
3253560	50006519	A 2nd hint: I have never been anywhere, and I mean anywhere that the TV was placed as low as you have yours.				
3253560	50006520	Bottom line, its a good value room surrounded by challenged management.				

3293463	50006530	Wonderful stay ---SEP---		80007098	Dear wrinaw, Thank you for your kind review.	
3293463	50006531	We were 6, staying in one of the Woodland Villas.		80007099	I am thrilled you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3293463	50006532	The villa was beautiful, well equipped and very comfortable.		80007100	It was great to read that you enjoyed the woodland villas, they are an ideal option for those travelling in a group, providing that additional space while still enjoying all the facilitities that the hotel has to offer.	
3293463	50006533	The villas are 15 minute walk from the hotel.		80007101	It was also brilliant to read that you enjoyed the grounds, the wornderful walks, the spa as well as the outdoor hot tubs.	
3293463	50006534	The hotel area is spectacular, with pretty walks, nice swimming pool and wonderful hot tub outside overlooking the sea and the woods around.		80007102	I was suprised to read you did not enjoy the food in the bar as we generally receive great feedback but thank you for your comments and I will certainly bring up at our weekly food and beverage meeting.	
3293463	50006535	We spent there 3 lovely days.		80007103	Thank you again for your kind review and I look forward to your next visit.	
3293463	50006536	We had lunch in the hotel's bar, didn't really like the food - we had pizzas that were more like frozen pizza than a pizza served in a pricy location.		80007104	Warmest Regards Ruth O' Sullivan General Manager	
3293463	50006537	Apart from that, everything was great.				
3293463	50006538	We'll probably return.				

3196187	50006540	Great Environment & Great Experience ---SEP---		80007115	Dear dmryoung1118, Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us at the Inn on Fifth every time you come to Naples.	
3196187	50006541	We stayed on the club side this time.		80007116	We are so happy to hear how much you enjoyed your anniversary weekend in our club level suites and that the extra amenities helped to make your stay extra special!	
3196187	50006542	We always have a great stay, but for an anniversary weekend, it made it even better.		80007117	We look forward to your next visit.	
3196187	50006543	The complimentary services that were offered made the weekend wonderful.				
3196187	50006544	We will continue to stay here ever time we come to Naples.				

3283008	50006550	Christmas Shopping Spree ---SEP---		80007128	Dear David W, Thank you for choosing to stay at Novotel Sydney Darling Harbour, it is always a pleasure having you stay with us	
3283008	50006551	The Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour provided the ideal place to stay whilst Christmas shopping in Sydney.		80007129	and I am glad to read you enjoyed your stay.	
3283008	50006552	The rooms, amenities, restaurant and staff were outstanding and made our stay very enjoyable.		80007130	We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel soon.

3163593	50006560	Signs of aging but great customer service		80007142	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.	
3163593	50006561	---SEP---		80007143	I am pleased to learn the team provided you with wonderful service and you enjoyed our great location.	
3163593	50006562	First room I got was outdated, all shower fixtures were falling off..		80007144	We look forward to welcoming you back soon!	
3163593	50006563	So I requested a room change.		80007145	Regards	
3163593	50006564	The hotel s showing the signs of aging but the staff s great n helpful.				
3163593	50006565	The pool area s awesome n the breakfast buffet s good but a bit pricey.				
3163593	50006566	But great location.				

3326045	50006570	A secluded diamond ---SEP---		80007156	Dear Cushla, Thank you so much for your amazing 5 star review of our beautiful lodge!	
3326045	50006571	We stayed here during the new year period and could not have asked for a more relaxing place.		80007157	My team and I were so ecstatic after reading your review.	
3326045	50006572	We booked in for the buffet breakfast on new year morning and were spoilt to one on one service with every dish available, made especially for us - probably one of the finest dining experiences we have ever experienced!		80007158	We are so pleased that you had an amazing experience at our Lodge.	
3326045	50006573	Our room was beautiful, spacious and luxurious.		80007159	It is great reviews like yours that motivate us to keep going the extra mile in order to provide superior customer service to our guests!	
3326045	50006574	The bathroom had double of everything and a computerised hot tub, as well as a spa out on our secluded terrace overlooking Hanmer and the hills.		80007160	We hope you will come stay with us again in the near future!	
3326045	50006575	There are also additional options for spa treatments on-site, as well as breakfast in bed, and all meals at the restaurant sourcing food from local produce.		80007161	Warm regards, Desmond Moraes	
3326045	50006576	Being 7km out of town and up a secluded gravel road it is very peaceful, quiet and still handy to the town.				
3326045	50006577	Although it is a more luxurious choice to stay, I would highly recommend it to any couple wanting an extra special night or weekend away.				

3173206	50006580	Favourite place to stay!		80007172	Thanks Brooke:)	
3173206	50006581	---SEP--- Had a wonderful time at the Edge of the Forest Motel for our over night stay..		80007173	so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3173206	50006582	Helpful staff, town centre was within walking distance, electric blankets perfect for this weather, a great variety of movies to choose from in reception if a chilled night in is desired.		80007174	We are really happy to give out tips to help everyone get the most out of our beautiful region.	
3173206	50006583	Rooms were definite value for money, and the garden was beautiful!		80007175	Hope the rose petals created a romantic atmosphere.	
3173206	50006584	A big thank you to the lady at reception on Monday morning who gave us so many hot spots to travel to during our mini road trip-- most of our great photos and fun wouldn't of happened without your help!		80007176	We look forward to seeing you again.	
3173206	50006585	Will definitely be back :-)				

3239637	50006590	Everything was great ---SEP--- Clean amenities and central in location make the Quest on Chapel a great city stopover location.		80007187	"Dear woodval3, Thank you for taking the time to review Quest on Chapel, we really appreciate all feedback, especially your ""5 star"" rating."	
3239637	50006591	Pleasant staff made my stay hassle free and hopefully will stay there again.		80007188	I am so pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay with us, and that our staff made your stay hassle free.

3222757	50006600	A Blue Mountain's Gem ---SEP---		80007202	Dear Valued Guest, I appreciate the time you have taken to provide us with your feedback regarding your recent stay at Lilianfels Blue Mountains Resort & Spa.	
3222757	50006601	We stayed 3 nights at Lilianfels.		80007203	It‚Äôs a pleasure to read that you had a great stay, enjoyed the facilities and that our team looked after you.	
3222757	50006602	Our room large and had an obscured view of the valley across the road.		80007204	I look forward to welcoming you back to Lilianfels Blue Mountains Resort & Spa in the near future.	
3222757	50006603	The bed was very comfortable and the mini bar well stocked.		80007205	With thanks, Ralf Bruegger Group General Manager	
3222757	50006604	The bathroom was size able with a long bath which was unexpected.				
3222757	50006605	The hotel is a short walk from the views of Echo Point and the many walks around the 3 sisters.				
3222757	50006606	"The hotel is set in beautiful gardens and the ""Hatted"" restaurant DARLEY'S is within the grounds."				
3222757	50006607	We ate at DARLEY'S and it was up with the best meals I have eaten.				
3222757	50006608	The service and quality of the surroundings makes it very enjoyable.				
3222757	50006609	I indulged in spa treatments - the spa is beautiful and the staff helpful and professional - a lovely way to end the day after a bush walk.				
3222757	50006610	Buffet was adequate it could have had a better selection of hot dishes but on the whole was enjoyable.				

3162110	50006620	EXcellant Family Room ---SEP--- Clean and convenient.		80007216	Thanks Russ M for your review, we agree the family apartments make for EXcellant family accommodation.	
3162110	50006621	Short walk to the village/strip for lunch, dinner and entertainment.		80007217	We are very happy you enjoyed your stay and thank you mum again for the hug, I appreciated that.	
3162110	50006622	Alison the host was engaging, informative and checked on our well being during our stay.		80007218	Cheers Alison.	
3162110	50006623	Apartment 7 would be eXcellant for a family up to 5				

3197339	50006630	Absolutely stunning!		80007229	Dear FrancesP, Thank you for writing such a lovely review of your stay at the Chateau, and for especially mentioning the friendliness of the team and the dining experience.	
3197339	50006631	---SEP---		80007230	I am glad that Rosie was able to assist you with your room	
3197339	50006632	We have only just left this beautiful Chateau after spending two glorious nights there.		80007231	and I look forward to welcoming you back again very soon.	
3197339	50006633	To reiterate previous reviews, the position and views are absolutely stunning.		80007232	With best wishes, Martin Martin Page General Manager	
3197339	50006634	My husband booked through Secret Escapes but spoke directly to the receptionist.				
3197339	50006635	We were looking to stay for two nights and at that time they only had a very small room available for the dates we wanted.				
3197339	50006636	She suggested we opt for The Stables which does not form part of the main Chateau but offers an open plan living dining area, kitchen, shower room and double bedroom.				
3197339	50006637	We were unable to see this particular room on the website but took her recommendation.				
3197339	50006638	When arrived much earlier than the 3 pm check in and were more than happy to wait for our room, we were shown to one of the lounges which had spectacular views and were offered tea and coffee.				
3197339	50006639	When we were shown the accommodation we were devastated!				
3197339	50006640	Whilst the chateau was full of charm and elegant grandeur, The Stables was bland, smelt damp and lacked any form of character!				
3197339	50006641	I could have cried!				
3197339	50006642	My husband chatted to Rosie, one of the lovely receptionists who found the most beautiful room for us.				
3197339	50006643	As mentioned in previous reviews our shower was in a turret - I should say showers as there were 3!				
3197339	50006644	I am not sure why				
3197339	50006645	but it looked spectacular and the showers were certainly efficient!				
3197339	50006646	Again we had magnificent views.				
3197339	50006647	Like one of the previous reviews, we too are fortunate enough to stay quite regularly in 5 star hotels but unlike that previous review, we love to see the individuality and eccentricities of places, and people.				
3197339	50006648	We can look past minor issues and concentrate on the overall experience.				
3197339	50006649	The overall experience?				
3197339	50006650	Wonderful.				
3197339	50006651	Every member of staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly.				
3197339	50006652	The 'dining experience' was just that.				
3197339	50006653	The experience was not just in the food, which we thoroughly enjoyed, but the meeting with everyone for canap√©s and wine, before being escorted down into the grand dining room.				
3197339	50006654	We are used to the type of menu on offer which we prefer, but if you are looking for huge, overfilling, heavy food, this is not for you.				
3197339	50006655	Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would hope to return.				

3240957	50006660	Good Modern Rooms but poorly maintained ---SEP--- Rooms look good modern with anything you will possibly need.		80007243	Dear santhosh46, Thank you for sharing your feedback and also taking your time to discuss your feedback with me directly.	
3240957	50006661	Only issue we had was the blocked washing machine from the previous guest.		80007244	We are disappointed to hear that we fell short of your expectations on this particular occasion.	
3240957	50006662	We Complained twice to fix this.		80007245	As we highly appreciate all feedback that we receive, please be assured that your comments have been duly noted and passed onto our management team for immediate improvements.	
3240957	50006663	Unfortunately until we checked out it was not fixed.		80007246	We do hope to welcome you back to Meriton Serviced Apartments in the not too distant future whether this be Parramatta, Sydney, Brisbane or the Gold Coast.	
3240957	50006664	I had stayed in other Meriton Apartments and never experienced such a bad thing..		80007247	Warm Regards, Patrick S., Guest Service Manager	

3246465	50006670	Wedding Stay ---SEP---		80007258	Dear Brandon R, Our team would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback about your most recent stay with us during such a special event for you, your family and friends.	
3246465	50006671	The hotel was nice, but a little over-priced.		80007259	It is our goal to not only provide outstanding customer service but to also provide amenities that will exceed our guest expectations.	
3246465	50006672	The bar prices were extreme, as I had one Knob Creek and Coke that cost $17.00.		80007260	Is there anything that we could have done better as a team or in our lounge to help you feel that you were getting the value for the price?	
3246465	50006673	Even for a hotel bar, that price was very steep.		80007261	We continue to work hard for each and everyone of your guests and your feedback is very important to us.	
3246465	50006674	The rooms were a typical hotel room.		80007262	I look forward to hearing from you again, Brandon and hope you have a wonderful week.	
3246465	50006675	Nothing to write home about.		80007263	Warm regards, Ashley Martinez | Assistant General Manager Hilton Garden Inn Denver Downtown Email: ashley.martinez@hilton.com	
3246465	50006676	All in all, it was a fine stay, it just seemed to be priced high for what it was.		80007264	O:303.603.8000 | D:303.379.0908 |

3259374	50006680	Exceptional Motel ---SEP---		80007276	WOW Thank you for taking the time to write your wonderful review.	
3259374	50006681	This is the kind of motel that leaves you wondering why you would ever pay to stay at a Sheraton or Hyatt ever again.		80007277	It gives Robyn, myself and our staff great satisfaction to present each and every room at it's very best, as if each new guest is the first to see it.	
3259374	50006682	Centrally located, incredibly modern and exceptionaly well furnished, this is the reason I keep going back to motels in the South Island.		80007278	We've tried to add points of difference to give that wow factor and sense of luxury by the extra's above the normal fittings and fixtures we have in each suite.	
3259374	50006683	Max was great, couldn't have been more helpful.		80007279	We are so please to have had the pleasure of your company during your stay with us and look forward to your next visit to Nelson.	
3259374	50006684	"The room was flawless and to an incredibly high standard, from simple details like the quality of linen used for the beds to more extensive touches like the high end tiled bathroom fittings, everything about the room said ""5 star""."				
3259374	50006685	You'd pay $400+ a night for a room half this size in a hotel in Wellington and not even be close to the quality of it.				
3259374	50006686	Great place!				

3207732	50006690	Fantastic!		80007280	Hi amandasjayne, Thank you so much for your lovely comments, we're pleased to read you enjoyed your stay with us again.	
3207732	50006691	---SEP---		80007281	We very much look forward to your return visit.	
3207732	50006692	Our 2nd time staying here.		80007282	Kind regards,	
3207732	50006693	Great motel.				
3207732	50006694	We had spa room.				
3207732	50006695	Was huge & tastefully furnished with the comfiest King bed.				
3207732	50006696	Very clean.				
3207732	50006697	Lovely management.				
3207732	50006698	Very quiet & right near the Bowling Club.				
3207732	50006699	Will be back!				

3224811	50006700	Unhappy ---SEP---		80007293	Dear Guest Many thanks for your review and your feedback regarding the hotel and our team.	
3224811	50006701	The view from my room was the roof top of vents, the noise from your generator or whatever it was so loud it prevented both I and my 2 year old Granddaughter from sleeping.		80007294	We are very disappointed to read your comments regarding our service and facilities.	
3224811	50006702	I had to go down to reception to complain and the Manager kindly had the source of the noise switched off, which I was grateful for.		80007295	We would love the opportunity to speak to you.	
3224811	50006703	I was awoken at 2.30am with a guest next door throwing up in their bathroom which I could hear quite clearly as the walls were paper-thin.		80007296	Please do contact us on 091 521 433 or email our Front Office Manager: cboyd@theardilaunhotel.ie to discuss your experience in a greater detail.	
3224811	50006704	We did have a lovely experience in your Leisure facilities.		80007297	We would like to thank you once again for your feedback and apologise for any inconvenience caused.	
3224811	50006705	We dined in your Bistro bar, while the food was beautiful, the service left a lot to be desired.		80007298	Kind regards,	
3224811	50006706	I would not be inclined to recommend your hotel.				

3168436	50006710	Rooms need refurb but wonderful service!!!		80007309	Dear Holly K, Thank you for choosing to stay at Park Hyatt Melbourne recently, we appreciate the time you have taken to provide your feedback.	
3168436	50006711	---SEP---		80007310	I was disappointed to read the hotel did not meet your expectations, and have shared your comments with the team at the hotel.	
3168436	50006712	The reason for a 3 star rating is because for the price you pay, you expect five star everything!		80007311	We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and will hopefully have the opportunity to welcome you back soon.	
3168436	50006713	The check-in staff was efficient, but not feiendly.		80007312	Regards Brett Sweetman ‚Äì Hotel Manager	
3168436	50006714	The room was as per photographs, but I found that the compendium was hidden away in a desk drawer, the phone's speed dial (for room service etc) was not programmed.				
3168436	50006715	The tv's Ethernet cable was loose and reception kept dropping out.				
3168436	50006716	The Juliet balcony door scraped against the curtain railing when you tried to open it, the front door did not open with the swipe card on a couple of occasions and the walls are paper thin where you can hear everything happening outside!!				
3168436	50006717	The tv in the spa bath was at a ridiculous height and tiny.				
3168436	50006718	The service of the room service and engineering staff were fantastic!!				
3168436	50006719	They were so quick to help with everything and absolutely fabulous to deal with!				
3168436	50006720	I cannot praise these guys enough.				
3168436	50006721	Unfortunately for some reason the late checkout that had been guaranteed through my booking type was not advised to the front desk staff and this resulted in an interrupted sleep in.				
3168436	50006722	I expected more from this brand and was disappointed at this hotel stay.				
3168436	50006723	I have been to functions here before, and it had been wonderful.				

3227972	50006730	Let down by the food ---SEP--- Stayed here with a bus party and was very much treated as such with regard to dining arrangements.		80007323	Dear Midge, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for completing one of our guest satisfaction surveys.	
3227972	50006731	Our 7pm dinner slot on the first evening was brought forward to 6pm for the rest of our stay due to some ‚Äòregulars‚Äô coming in.		80007324	I am delighted to read that you enjoyed your overall stay with us.	
3227972	50006732	Dinner was ordered in advance where we had to tick what we wanted next time (hospital-style and plated).		80007325	I have passed onto the management team your comments in relation to your stay in order to improve upon our current standards and procedures and have spoken with the Food & Beverage Manager in relation to your comments on dinner.	
3227972	50006733	There wasn‚Äôt much choice and a lot of my food was unappetising and lukewarm, eg, my dried-up macaroni was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables.		80007326	I will ensure your feedback is passed onto all staff.	
3227972	50006734	Breakfast was buffet style and very good.		80007327	I hope to see you again soon on your next visit.	
3227972	50006735	When the absence of side plates and saucers at dinner was queried, the person in charge of the dining room explained that these are no longer provided.		80007328	Kind Regards Gary Taylor General Manager	
3227972	50006736	It was suggested we use the table or our napkin to spread the dinner roll.				
3227972	50006737	No complaints with the accommodation, location of the hotel or friendliness of the staff.				

3279430	50006740	Brighton Rocks ---SEP---		80007339	Dear Reviewer, Thank you for adding your review, I am delighted to read that you and your son enjoyed your stay at our Hotel, but also what Brighton has to offer.	
3279430	50006741	Excellent hotel - I stayed there with my son after an early start for our journey to Brighton University open day.		80007340	Once again, thank you for your feedback.	
3279430	50006742	We stayed in a single room each - they were spacious, clean, well positioned and priced reasonably for a Friday night.		80007341	Regards Ross	
3279430	50006743	The hotel was busy mainly with tourists on agenda's and other guests with a little more attitude than their personal wealth and taste would justify - however, that is of no fault of the hotel.				
3279430	50006744	We dined out at the 'Casalingo' owned by Angelo Martinoli...				
3279430	50006745	I very highly recommend this restaurant if you truly love Italian food, it is as authentic as it gets outside of Italy.				
3279430	50006746	A pleasant stay on a busy night in a well positioned hotel which still retains it's splendour.				
3279430	50006747	As a fan of the film 'Quadrophenia' it only remained for me to shout the immortal cry of 'Bell-boy' as we drove out of Brighton passed both the Grand Hotel and the Metropole!				

3171348	50006750	Amazing!		80007352	Thanks for dinging with us in our Four Seasons Restaurant Sums15.	
3171348	50006751	---SEP---		80007353	We appreciate your business and are truly thankful to you for posting a 5-star rating here on TripAdvisor for other travelers to read.

3171348	50006753	He was super fun and friendly.		80007355	We'll be sure to recognize them for going above and beyond in their customer service.	
3171348	50006754	Andrew and Polash and Ryan made us an amazing meal!		80007356	The greatest compliment we ever receive is a returning customer, and we look forward to serving you again in the future.	
3171348	50006755	The chicken cordon blue and medium rare ribeye steak was cooked perfectly!!				
3171348	50006756	The meal arrived quickly.				
3171348	50006757	Definitely coming back!				
3171348	50006758	Thank you!!

3307298	50006764	Surrounding: excellent location with nice restaurants and bars within quarter mile radius.				
3307298	50006765	Check-out: quick and with a smile!				
3307298	50006766	Definitely will stay at this hotel and brand in the future!!				

3190658	50006770	Great Getaway!		80007370	Thank you for kindly reviewing Stormy Point Village.	
3190658	50006771	---SEP--- Love the nautical theme!		80007371	"We are thrilled to hear you had such a wonderful time enjoying the resort and our Monday morning ""Breakfast with the Stars"" activity."	
3190658	50006772	Thanks for the teaser shows on Monday morning.		80007372	Our staff works hard to ensure each guest has a clean and comfortable stay and they will be happy to hear you appreciated it.	
3190658	50006773	We were able to make some show selections that we possible would not have booked.		80007373	We hope to have you back staying with us again soon.	
3190658	50006774	The resort is very well manicured and the condo was clean.				
3190658	50006775	We had everything we need!				
3190658	50006776	Thanks for the wonderful vacation experience!				

3219322	50006780	Top Stay Top 10 ---SEP--- Originally planned to stay one night but was happy with the location, quietness and friendliness of the staff.		80007384	hanks for your Five Star rating - we like getting great feedback about the Hotel and the team.	
3219322	50006781	A nice place to chill-out and get some work done in between client visits.		80007385	We hope that you can come back again some time soon.	
3219322	50006782	Would definitely come back and stay again.				

3313195	50006790	Sydney Marriot 36 Hr.		80007396	Dear Kevin S, Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us during your recent business trip and for sharing this amazing review with other travelers on TripAdvisor.	
3313195	50006791	Business Trip 10/10 ---SEP---		80007397	We are delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay at the Sydney Harbour Marriott and that the wonderful attentive service from our associates made all the difference.	
3313195	50006792	The staff, the room quality, the service, the lounge, the front desk and the concierge were fantastic (10/10).		80007398	I know that they appreciate your kind words and recognition and we look forward in welcoming you back in the near future.	
3313195	50006793	My team got in around 6am for a one and a half day stay.		80007399	Warm regards, Jennifer Brown General Manager	
3313195	50006794	We were guided on what to see in a short amount of time and were able to see two beaches, (Manley/Bondi) and eat great as well.				
3313195	50006795	Hotel is clean and staff make every effort to help you.				
3313195	50006796	I suggest running the harbor around the opera house, up the hills through the botanical gardens and over to where the battleships are.				

3280853	50006800	Waikiki Resort ---SEP---		80007400	Aloha Andrea, Thank you for taking the time to recognize our friendly staff.	
3280853	50006801	We had several issues with our stay but Branden always knew how to help!		80007401	They work hard to ensure our guests have an incredible experience.	
3280853	50006802	He pointed us in the right direction every time.		80007402	We appreciate your business and look forward to hosting you again.	
3280853	50006803	The last day June was a big help as I had to find a way to get my breast milk back home to my baby boy.				
3280853	50006804	As far as the hotel it was nice and clean.				
3280853	50006805	Bathroom was very small though.				
3280853	50006806	Homeless people everywhere as well as construction.				
3280853	50006807	All of that aside the hotel was fantastic!				

3296452	50006810	Minimoon Whitby Break ---SEP---		80007413	Hi Phil, thanks for the review and glad we could make your mini honeymoon a special stay.	
3296452	50006811	A wonderful bed and breakfast with possibly the best poached eggs I have ever had.		80007414	Hope to see you again with the rest of your family.	
3296452	50006812	Friendly family who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.		80007415	regards Simon	
3296452	50006813	On arrival we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of Prosecco as well as a huge pot of tea and generous servings of home-made coffee & walnut cake.				
3296452	50006814	We will definitely be returning when we get the chance.				

3196017	50006820	Very hilly and lots of trees and greenery.		80007426	Hi Marina, I gather that you are the person that complained about the showers to the Campground Host.	
3196017	50006821	---SEP---		80007427	They in turn investigated the problem and found that there was a problem with the propane heating unit and called me.	
3196017	50006822	The campsite is set on the side of a hill.		80007428	The Host closed the showers.	
3196017	50006823	The gravel road is windy and steep.		80007429	The problem was found to be a partial blockage of the water tube.	
3196017	50006824	There were alot of children playing and riding bicycles so you have to drive slowly and be on the lookout.		80007430	The system was flushed , tested and back in service within 45 min.	
3196017	50006825	The showers had hardly any hot water.		80007431	there has been no reported problem since.	
3196017	50006826	They would alternate between hot and cold water every minute or so, mostly cold.		80007432	If readers look back at earlier reviews they will find the performance and cleanliness of our showers are above standard.	
3196017	50006827	The Manager Lynn was very friendly.		80007433	I hope this meets your standard of expectation of service.	
3196017	50006828	There was traffic noise but it was quiet between 11 to 6 am.		80007434	If you had inquired further before writing your review we would have been happy to explain.	
3196017	50006829	Tent sites are hard packed gravel so take a hammer to pound in tent stakes.		80007435	Regarding the topgraphy of our island if you investigate the geology of our area you will find that Salt Spring Island is the result of volcanic upheaval and similar to other such Islands it considered part of it's natural beauty.	
3196017				80007436	Our Campground is blended into this topography.	
3196017				80007437	I have read your reviews of other places on Salt Spring Island and would recomend readers to do likewise to get a background of your reviewing style Thank you for taking the time to write a review, Ian Kyle Owner	

3230399	50006830	One night stopover on our way to Marton ---SEP--- Arrived early evening.		80007448	Hi cillar212, We are glad you noticed things such as us warming the room prior to your arrival and turning the lights on for you - we truly want to make guests feel comfortable, welcome and warm.	
3230399	50006831	The reception was welcoming and friendly.		80007449	Also glad that you enjoyed the food at the restaurant - we will pass on the compliments to the chef!	
3230399	50006832	The heater and lights were on in the room.		80007450	Thanks for the review and if any friends are passing through please let them know about us.	
3230399	50006833	A nice touch.		80007451	Regards, Craig	
3230399	50006834	Modern interior.				
3230399	50006835	Big bed.				
3230399	50006836	Lovely decor.				
3230399	50006837	The restaurant attached to the motor lodge had a lovely atmosphere.				
3230399	50006838	Our meals were delicious and the waitress was friendly.				
3230399	50006839	My husband and I will definitely be staying here again.

3282359	50006850	Thank you it was a pleasure ---SEP---		80007462	What a fabulous review Jaw - we were all so pleased to read that your plans and celebrations were such a success, you must have earned a lot of brownie points!!	
3282359	50006851	The trip was for my partners 40th, she hates surprises so decided to invite friends to stay and enjoy dinner at the Connaught.		80007463	Thank you so much for such a delightful and comprehensive review which was very much appreciated by each and every one of us.	
3282359	50006852	We were well looked after from start to finish and enjoyed a fantastic weekend!		80007464	Best wishes and thank you for choosing to stay with us.	
3282359	50006853	We were warmly greeted at reception and whilst checking in my partner was wished Happy Birthday (simple touch, well received) we had decided to spend a little extra and were booked into the Orchid Suite.		80007465	David F Miller Managing Director Executive rooms booked direct with the hotel are now guaranteed their own, personal parking space!!	
3282359	50006854	Room was lovely, spacious, with two seating areas and a fantastic bathroom with roll top bath and double shower.		80007466	Book direct - 01202 298020	
3282359	50006855	Room was spotless and the bed was very comfy!!		80007467	- we guarantee the lowest prices and it ensures you get the room and the bath or shower that you want.	
3282359	50006856	We had booked dinner for 35 guests and were shown to our private dinner room, which again was stunning, The tables were imaculate, dressed in white with a blue color scheme and everything we could possibly need was on hand.		80007468	Our standard rooms average 135 sq ft., superiors with a balcony 155 sq ft, superiors without 175 sq ft and Executives 210 sq ft.	
3282359	50006857	We and our guests started to arrive at around 1pm and I think its safe to say took over the bar area, we enjoyed a lovely lunch and moved chairs and tables to accomodate the expanding guests.				
3282359	50006858	The staff were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble.				
3282359	50006859	A number of us enjoyed lunch and smiles all round.				
3282359	50006860	Most of us relaxing in the bar area till 5pm.				
3282359	50006861	Dinner started at 7:30pm and once and the staff were fantastic, all three course were delivered in efficient, yet attentive manner, once again nothing was too much trouble!!				
3282359	50006862	My partner was served first for every course (something myself i did not noticed) but another small touch that went a long way.				
3282359	50006863	I enjoyed Lamb for the main and would happily book again.				
3282359	50006864	We headed off into the night, I understand those that left the highlights of the town, were then relaxing in the bar till 2-3am (unsure of the time) but were once again well looked after.				
3282359	50006865	Breakfast the next morning was enjoyed in the bar area, with the staff members on duty remember the guests from our party and guiding them through to join us.				
3282359	50006866	Breakfast had a lovely choice of all the standard options and was once again all fantastic.				
3282359	50006867	I did have a little telling off from the food manager (I presume) as I went to help myself but was told 'No				
3282359	50006868	No No, you look, we serve' all said with a smile (I hope).				
3282359	50006869	My breakfast started at 9am				
3282359	50006870	but I didn't leave till gone 10:30 as more friends joined us, during this whole time tea and coffee was readily available and again nothing!!				
3282359	50006871	yes nothing was too much trouble..				
3282359	50006872	We then checked out and headed in to Bournemouth, we were allowed to leave our car, thank you for that.				
3282359	50006873	On returning decided to have one more drink in the bar before heading home.				
3282359	50006874	We choose the hotel as at the time it was rated as number one in Bournemouth, I am not sure if this is still the case.				
3282359	50006875	But the hotel has done my partner and I proud this weekend and all of our friend were positive about their stay.				
3282359	50006876	Not sure what else I can add, highly suggest a visit and would book again without question.				
3282359	50006877	The only thing I should add, I found the walls a little thin in the bed room, could hear the people in the next room chatting and laughing, but as I had enjoyed a few cocktails was not really worried.				
3282359	50006878	Thanks again!!				

3212273	50006880	Came right in the end ---SEP--- Stayed 1 nite in March checked in & was very impressed with the decor reminded me something out of new your, room basic shame it didn't reflect the decor downstairs.		80007479	Dear jacfive, Thank you so much for staying with us recently and for taking the time to write of your experience, we really appreciate it.	
3212273	50006881	Decided to have a bath after running it discovered it was cold tried running the taps still cold rang reception said they would sort it 50 mins later nothing done I got dressed & went to reception manager came to room to check it still cold he said he was sorry		80007480	We work hard to ensure that all our guests have the best possible stay with us, and unfortunately on occasion, things can and do go wrong for whatever reason, but we are glad to hear that it was fully sorted to your satisfaction, it is always your opinion that really to matters to us.	
3212273	50006882	but there was nothing he could & left, I was fuming ad hot water is a basic requirement		80007481	We would be delighted to be your host in the future and you can rest assured, you will receive the warmest of warm Clayton Hotel Dublin airport welcomes!	
3212273	50006883	so I went back to reception & told them it wasn't good enough reception gave me a full refund & said the nite was on them & sorry hopefully the hot water would be sorted unfortunately there was no hot water till the morn & as we were flying early that morning had to do with a quick shower, But they recognised the fault & finally dealt with it & reimbursed me thank you Clapton üëç		80007482	Kind regards, Catherine Roche	

3166815	50006890	Ryanair-style resort ---SEP---		80007493	Dear Guest, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your opinion of your recent stay with us at the Parknasilla Resort & Spa on Trip advisor.	
3166815	50006891	This hotel is about 18 months beyond the point of needing minor renovation.		80007494	I was of course disappointed to read that you were not entirely satisfied with your stay and would like to address the points you have mentioned.	
3166815	50006892	Carpets on the stairs are threadbare and overworn.		80007495	While some of the hotel has been refurbished recently we are continually trying to improve our product where possible.	
3166815	50006893	Very disappointed with the room, it was pretty small and the carpets were threadbare in spots and paint peeling off the walls.		80007496	The hotel is graded as a four star hotel and resort, and this how we market it.	
3166815	50006894	The bathroom door had warped due to steam and as a result it could not shut.		80007497	We provide complimentary bathrobes for guests who have booked our Spa treatments or one of our many packages which include overnight stays in our executive bedrooms and suites.	
3166815	50006895	No bathrobes in the room, they were to be hired as extra!!		80007498	I can assure you that the team and I are very proud of the hotel and the level of service we provide in Parknasilla as can be seen in the previous reviews, however in the current climate the financial control aspect plays a vital role in a business‚Äôs survival.	
3166815	50006896	We stayed in Parknasilla on the first night of 4.		80007499	This also allows us to offer good rates and also different packages that will include all the extras.	
3166815	50006897	It claimed to be 4* and pretends to be 5* however, we stayed in a 3 star three days later and they supplied bathrobes!!!		80007500	Should you wish to discuss any part of your review in more detail please feel free to contact me here at the hotel, where I would be more than happy to do so.	
3166815	50006898	Small touches make the difference!!		80007501	I can be contacted via email on amansworth@parknasillahotel.ie or else please feel free to speak me on 064 667 5600.	
3166815	50006899	The staff were very helpful but did leave a little short on the efficiency stakes.		80007502	Once again thank you for taking the time to share your opinion on the Parknasilla Resort and Spa, we value all feedback here at the hotel.	
3166815	50006900	The location is absolutely breathtaking but realistically I would not be going back.		80007503	It is such a shame you never mentioned to these issues whilst you were staying with us as we could have rectified them and restored your faith in our beautiful property.	
3166815	50006901	This hotel is in financial difficulty and it is pretty easy to see that a bean counter is running the show, not a hotelier.		80007504	I look forward to hearing from you.	
3166815	50006902	I would compare it to a ryanair-style establishment, for a finish I was surprised they were not charging us for the use of the cutlery!!		80007505	Warmest Regards Aaron Mansworth Area General Manager	

3277846	50006910	Nice Hotel but Not the Town ---SEP---		80007516	We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us, whilst we cannot control the experience of the city, we can certainly control your hotel experience and we endeavour to continue on improving this and the customer service we provide.	
3277846	50006911	This hotel was nice		80007517	I hope that you take the time to visit the hotel and city again in the near future.	
3277846	50006912	but I would just rather have skipped the town.		80007518	There are lots of positive developments happening over the coming years in the city including the refurbishment of Kings Johns Castle, City of Culture 2014 and numurous other positive events and additions to the already large amount of cultural attractions that are on offer.	
3277846	50006913	It did not seem as safe as other areas in Ireland.		80007519	I hope that you will allow more time on your return to explore and experience our wonderful city.	
3277846	50006914	Th hotel was not as close to shopping and pubs as the other locations we stayed in Ireland.				
3277846	50006915	The streets and different areas were not as clean as others in Ireland.				
3277846	50006916	I would recommend you not venture out alone at night.				
3277846	50006917	The wait staff at the hotel were fine but not notable.				
3277846	50006918	We were only there one night so my opinion might not be what others would share.				
3277846	50006919	My room was nice and modern.				
3277846	50006920	If I ever return to Limerick I would consider staying here.				

3226813	50006930	Keep in Mind ---SEP---		80007520	Thank you so much for your feedback in regards to your stay.	
3226813	50006931	The thing that really ticked me off about this place is the internet.		80007521	Its help us here at the hotel so much improve on our customer satsifaction.	
3226813	50006932	"Not because it went down several times, but each time it did, I had to watch a video to ""EARN my free wifi."		80007522	I have contacted our internet provider in regards to the video to login I agree it can be frustrating	
3226813	50006933	"""I had to choose either a VW or Audit video to watch for 30 seconds, several times in one day."		80007523	and I hope to rectify it immediately for our guests.	
3226813	50006934	That, is not free.		80007524	Our carpets are being professionaly cleaned this week, the 5th floor was completed about 2 weeks ago.	
3226813	50006935	I don't appreciate it.		80007525	Due to the higher occupancy we were unable to get more accomplished, however they are scheduled to be back on Monday and Tuesday to finish the public areas.	
3226813	50006936	Call it what it is: Free with forced viewing.		80007526	I truly do apologize about the odor and I hope you see an improvement on your next stay.	
3226813	50006937	Really lame.		80007527	Hot water is available 24 hours it is a push top not like the other ones where there is a lever.	
3226813	50006938	The elevator: Around the 4th floor and above, it creaks loudly and seems to hit things as it goes up.		80007528	My staff and I are always available to make sure you have everything you need and I will make sure to have them be more observant in that area.	
3226813	50006939	If you're not a fan of elevators, you won't like it.		80007529	We are also making some more improvements to our breakfast to meet some of the requests we have had.	
3226813	50006940	It's a little disturbing.		80007530	We recently added hot chocolate as well as Biscuits and Gravy will be added twice a week.	
3226813	50006941	When you first get in, the DINGS of each elevator level passing are deafening.		80007531	During your next visit please contact me via email at shitalpatel5@hotmail.com or telephone in regards to your specific diet and I will make every attempt to make sure you start your day right with a breakfast you can enjoy.	
3226813	50006942	No joke!		80007532	Overall I am glad you will be back so that we can show you the improvements we have made and will be making for you and all of our other valued guests.	
3226813	50006943	Not an exaggeration.		80007533	Best regards, Shital Patel	
3226813	50006944	The floor I was on smelled like someone needs to steam clean the carpets.				
3226813	50006945	Thank goodness				
3226813	50006946	the maid covered it up my individual room on the second day with some spray, but it smells like a steamy shower that needs to be cleaned.				
3226813	50006947	Not moldy, but it smells like things I'd rather not write here.				
3226813	50006948	I did not report this, because the whole floor smells.				
3226813	50006949	It's just worse when one enters the room.				
3226813	50006950	It's a warm, gross bodily type smell.				
3226813	50006951	Other than the odor, room appeared clean.				
3226813	50006952	I'm not sure if hot water is for breakfast only, but in the lobby, there is a closed pitcher that says MY Morning Breakfast Water. ??				
3226813	50006953	Does everyone only drink coffee?				
3226813	50006954	I was looking for some hot water to go with the tea bags at night.				
3226813	50006955	Breakfast is the usual chemical fest, with only 2% and non-fat milk (???).				
3226813	50006956	Looks like someone is reading their 1970's nutrition guide.				
3226813	50006957	Then, activia, carbs, carbs, colorful carbs, some food I didn't even bother open.				
3226813	50006958	The only free breakfast I ever somewhat tolerated was Hyatt Express with their croissant-like egg and spinach like concoctions, to be fair.				
3226813	50006959	I stayed at a hotel with whole milk cartons, that was the majority of the takeaways.				
3226813	50006960	The door to my room was really really heavy, and trying to get luggage in and holding the door open was quite a feat.				
3226813	50006961	At least I didn't hear constant door slams.				
3226813	50006962	All in all, I would stay here again because hotels are on some kick about paying more when one books closer to the date, and saving when one books in the distance.				
3226813	50006963	I refuse to book like an airline.				
3226813	50006964	This one of the few with a decent rating and a decent value.				
3226813	50006965	Also, the staff is nice and if they'd just make some very minor improvements, it could be really good.				

3264785	50006970	Amazing staff - Great Location!		80007544	Dear Donna B, Thank you for such a wonderful review on this platform.	
3264785	50006971	---SEP--- Staff are super friendly and helpful.		80007545	We appreciate your kind words about the Hotel and staff.	
3264785	50006972	The location is literally within walking distance to everything.		80007546	It is pleasure to hear that you loved the location, liked the room, and loved the hotel.	
3264785	50006973	Oxford Street shopping is 2 blocks from the hotel.		80007547	It is pleasure to know that you will be booking us again and we eagerly look forward to serve you again Warmest Regards Prashant Marne	
3264785	50006974	Being in the middle of Soho there are so many restaurants to choose from and Covent Garden is about a 4 minute walk.				
3264785	50006975	Also 2 x tube stations within a 3-4 minute walk.				
3264785	50006976	The rooms are larger than most you'll see in London, however the bathrooms are small.. but how much time do you really spend in a bathroom :)				
3264785	50006977	Great wifi, hairdryer, nespresso machine and safe are provided along with a local smart phone at no extra cost that you can use to navigate the many London areas.				
3264785	50006978	I love this hotel, i loved that the windows could be opened for fresh air.				
3264785	50006979	I've stayed at many in London over the years, and iv finally found somewhere i know for sure i'll book again.				

3267671	50006980	The PHAT Doubletree ---SEP---		80007558	Dear Reverend - I'm delighted you enjoyed your stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton Denver!	
3267671	50006981	Everything Double Tree promised.		80007559	As a Colorado neighbor, I know you're familiar with the many lodging choices you have in the area so thank you for making our hotel your home away from home.	
3267671	50006982	They did deliver.		80007560	I hope we see you often - to take in a Rockies game this summer, do some shopping at Northfield, or catch a show Downtown.	
3267671	50006983	The hotel is an A plus hotel.		80007561	We'll have a warm chocolate chip cookie waiting for you!	
3267671	50006984	I recommend this Doubletree Hotel located in Denver Colorado at 3302 Quebec Street to all who is traveling to Denver.		80007562	Sincerely, Allen Paty, General manager	
3267671	50006985	This hotel is a must STAY hotel.				
3267671	50006986	You and your family will thank me.

3207764	50006990	Great stay in Tampa Bay ---SEP---		80007573	Dear Laura P, I am happy to hear you found our hotel to be clean and comfortable, that the staff was friendly, and that the nearby airport did not disrupt your stay.	
3207764	50006991	The staff is great!		80007574	I truly appreciate the time it took for you to provide your feedback.	
3207764	50006992	The hotel is clean and comfortable.		80007575	Thank you for sharing and come back to visit us again soon.	
3207764	50006993	Even though the hotel is close to the airport, it is not a distraction and not noisy.		80007576	Best Regards, Nikki C. Guest Relations Associate	
3207764	50006994	The views are fantastic and the on site restaurants are fab.				
3207764	50006995	I was here for a conference and being in the same venue for work and stay is great.				

3257012	50007000	Special Attention ---SEP---		80007587	Dear Mary Z, Thank you for choosing the Renaissance Denver Stapleton Hotel for your Colorado ADR Conference.	
3257012	50007001	Thanks so much to the entire Banquets staff assisting at the Colorado ADR Conference.		80007588	Your compliments were a pleasure to read.	
3257012	50007002	Especially to Karan Dafal and Ajay!!		80007589	We're delighted to learn you were thoroughly spoiled by our team.	
3257012	50007003	Loved meeting the international staff members!		80007590	We will be sure to share your fantastic compliments with Karan and Ajay.	
3257012	50007004	The food was delicious Thanks so much!		80007591	We look forward to having you as our guest again soon.	
3257012				80007592	Thanks again, Brian Lenfestey General Manager	

3260957	50007010	Great views of the lake ---SEP---		80007603	Thank you for your review, these are important to us and we appreciate that people take the time after their holidays to post these.	
3260957	50007011	I stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment with our 3 kids in July.		80007604	We must point out for the benefit of other guests, that Wifi is offered complimentary to all guests, this is stated on our website and in our Guest Information folders in our apartments.	
3260957	50007012	We especially enjoyedthe stunning views from both balconies on the first and second floors.		80007605	"There is an option for people to pay for Wifi access online if they visit the ""Surfspot"" website, this service is there for people other than our own guests who require internet access."	
3260957	50007013	The major dissapointment was the layout of the apartment, it has 3 stories with 1 bedroom on the top level, the middle level is the living area with kitchen/laundry, dining and TV room, the lower level has 2 more bedrooms.		80007606	We apologize if this was not clearly communicated to you on check in.	
3260957	50007014	All of this is great except that the 2 bathroom/toilets are both on the lower level right next to each other.		80007607	Inrrespect to the bathrooms, may we point out that one bathroom is an ensuite off the master bedroom and the other is across the hall from 2nd bedroom.	
3260957	50007015	Free wireless was not included, it is available at cost.		80007608	There access is not situated side by side.	
3260957	50007016	Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay.		80007609	We are very pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again in the future.	

3287877	50007020	We love this place!		80007610	I wanted to personally THANK YOU for taking the time to write a nice review of our hotel.	
3287877	50007021	---SEP---		80007611	Feedback like yours is crucial to our future success!	
3287877	50007022	My friends and I stayed here before and after cruising to Mexico.		80007612	I am so very happy that we made an impression on you and we want to invite you back to stay with us.	
3287877	50007023	The staff was extremely accommodating and the GM, David Blevins, was wonderful.		80007613	I hope to see you again real soon.	
3287877	50007024	The hotel was clean and conveniently located to the airport as well as a wonderful little shopping area.		80007614	Sincerely, David Blevins GM	
3287877	50007025	We will definitely be back again!				

3307428	50007030	Excellent location and service ---SEP---		80007625	Dear kasiakC3953KT, Thank you for your kind feedback.	
3307428	50007031	Great central location in Sydney CBD.		80007626	I was very pleased to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us, and found everything to be to your liking.	
3307428	50007032	Rooms are quiet, comfortable, well appointed, and relaxing.		80007627	I was also very pleased to read that you were able to take advantage of our central location!	
3307428	50007033	"Reception staff were outstanding- we had to change our ""non-changeable"" booking due to unforeseen circumstances to the following day and it was accommodated without any hassles or additional payment."		80007628	We look forward to welcoming you back to the Swissotel Sydney in the near future.	
3307428	50007034	I also accidentally booked a double bed room configuration, rather than a king bed, and again this was changed on request without any hassle or explanation.		80007629	Kind Regards, Ross Buchanan Executive Assistant Manager	
3307428	50007035	Highly recommend this hotel.				

3238291	50007040	Great Location but a tired venue with appalling food.		80007630	Dear Darren A Thank you for the review and it is a shame you chose to endure the hotel room during your stay without asking at reception if there was an alternative we could move you to.	
3238291	50007041	---SEP---		80007631	We don't serve T Bone steak however again if you were unhappy with the product give us an opportunity to put it right rather than hiding behind the keyboard.	
3238291	50007042	I was staying at this hotel as part of a work contract and must say that the whole experience was a rather disappointing one to say the least.		80007632	Sincerley	
3238291	50007043	The room itself faced out onto the main road which was also quite noisy throughout the night.				
3238291	50007044	The room was also tired and in need of a total overhaul to be brought in line with the amount that the hotel is charging guests currently.				
3238291	50007045	The staff themselves were very friendly but I did suffer the misfortune of having to eat in the restaurant.				
3238291	50007046	I selected a T-bone steak at a cost of ¬£22.50 and as you can see by the accompanying image this was a most disappointing experience and one that, once again does not justify the cost.				
3238291	50007047	If you want to be pretty much in the centre of Cambridge then you can't go too far wrong				
3238291	50007048	but I would advise eating out as a definite and a re-furb should be a high priority for this rather tired and dated hotel.				

3201724	50007050	Good Business stay ---SEP---		80007643	Thank you for your good review of our hotel and we will look into your suggestion.	
3201724	50007051	I stayed in this hotel for around 10 days during a business trip.		80007644	We are glad you enjoyed your long stay and hope to will return the next time you have business in our area.	
3201724	50007052	The staffs in the hotel are very friendly and the check in and check out process were very smooth.				
3201724	50007053	Rooms are also very good with all the required amenities.				
3201724	50007054	I like the morning complemental hot breakfast and the evening happy hour very much.				
3201724	50007055	The hotel also provide a complemental drop and pick up nearby to the hotel.				
3201724	50007056	There is also a small swimming pool and a health club located in the hotel.				
3201724	50007057	Just one suggestion				
3201724	50007058	, there were some problems with the wi-fi connection in some of the floor in hotel.				

3186300	50007060	Great location .........		80007655	Thank you for your review, do wonder if you are so unhappy why extend your stay also by your own admission in office you admitted the amenities smelt clean due to the strong cleaning products used, we are very disappointed that you were unhappy.	
3186300	50007061	That is all ---SEP---		80007656	You fail to mention even though you came in threatening to put a comment on this site prior to actually paying that our Manager, for the 2nd time that day, spent 6 hours scrubbing toilets.	
3186300	50007062	Seems all attention must go to cabins as caravan sites are not very good.		80007657	I thank you for your comments on the grounds, I will ensure your comments are passed onto our 3 girls who spent 5 hours in the gardens on Thursday	
3186300	50007063	Sites VERY uneven & not maintained.		80007658	and I will also pass on your comment to our mowing contractor who I believe was mowing the day you departed.	
3186300	50007064	(Lots of excuses in previous reviews but we've stayed in enough parks to know if any effort has gone in to keeping sites in good condition)				
3186300	50007065	We were there 4 days & didn't see anyone tending the grounds the whole time.				
3186300	50007066	Lawns very long & grounds generally shabby.				
3186300	50007067	Old car battery left at base of tree.				
3186300	50007068	No one noticed it.				
3186300	50007069	Amenities are hosed out rather than mopped so have soaking pools of water almost all the time.				
3186300	50007070	All Rubbish bins kept by amenities block rather than dotted around park.				
3186300	50007071	A bit inconvenient having to walk your Rubbish over there each time.				
3186300	50007072	Great location is the only thing going for it.				

3176274	50007080	Surprise Party at the Inn on 5th!		80007669	Dear Alan T, Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us at Inn on Fifth!	
3176274	50007081	---SEP---		80007670	We are all so happy to hear that the surprise went well and all came together successfully!!	
3176274	50007082	What an anazing weekend.		80007671	We look forward to having you come visit with us again.	
3176274	50007083	I could not recommend this hotel and staff enough.				
3176274	50007084	Long story- here it goes.				
3176274	50007085	I wanted to plan a surprise birthday party for my wife - it was one of those milestone birthdays that most of us try not to acknowledge - I promised I wouldn‚Äôt.... üôÇ				
3176274	50007086	The hotel was amazing.				
3176274	50007087	They gave me a block of rooms for the guests at a special rate, helped with the check in, and arranged all the small details.				
3176274	50007088	And did I mention this was a surprise party?				
3176274	50007089	The extra details needed to check in the 25 guests, keep my wife busy at the spa, and keep us aware of her movements was fantastic!				
3176274	50007090	Gloria set up the initial rooms, Noris handled the catering and bar, Stephanie arranged the details, and Nancy the Club Level concierge pulled it all together.				
3176274	50007091	The party was a success, the surprise was a success, and the guests who came from Miami, New York, Colorado and Boca had an amazing time!				
3176274	50007092	I‚Äôll be back to Naples in a few weeks and looking forward to staying at the Inn on 5th again!				
3176274	50007093	Thanks to everyone!				

3253700	50007100	Amazing overnight stay!		80007682	We are so glad to hear we exceeded your expectations!	
3253700	50007101	---SEP---		80007683	THank you for such wonderful comments.	
3253700	50007102	Booked the waterside king and was so surprised with the room.		80007684	We hope to welcome you back again soon.	
3253700	50007103	Exceeded our expectations.				
3253700	50007104	The room was spacious and very beautiful.				
3253700	50007105	The staff was very accommodating as soon as we entered the hotel.				
3253700	50007106	Early check in & late check out request was both honoured.				
3253700	50007107	We also used the hotel's valet car service.				
3253700	50007108	when the car was brought around we were pleasantly surprised the hotel provided two bottles of water in our car.				
3253700	50007109	Small gesture but was greatly appreciated.				
3253700	50007110	Room walls may be a little thin and you can sometimes hear the outside but no big deal.				
3253700	50007111	Only negative i have is we only stayed the one night.				
3253700	50007112	Looking forward to staying again longer in future.				

3169062	50007120	Great location, great service ---SEP--- Had the pleasure of staying at park inn in early April, rooms are great, comfortable bed, lovely shower.		80007695	Dear Andy K Thank you for your stay and positive review.	
3169062	50007121	Restaurant great to eat in, food great and service from shauna was exceptional.		80007696	I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and I will ensure that Shauna sees your nice comments.	
3169062	50007122	Will definitely stay here regularly		80007697	Kind regards Darren	

3270301	50007130	Location is good but there are better places to stay ---SEP---		80007708	Thank you for your feedback	
3270301	50007131	I was quite surprised that the combined information from the reviews did not match the experience.		80007709	Goannago, we take all feedback on board and are actively committed to ensuring all of our guests have the best possible time while staying with us.	
3270301	50007132	I usually find that I get a pretty accurate gauge from reading about the best and worst aspects of a place.		80007710	I am pleased to advise that we are currently in the process of replacing the carpet and at the same time installing the best quality sound insulation and re-seating the floor boards.	
3270301	50007133	"I agree that this place does have ""olde world charm"" but I don't think that this is enough to redeem it."		80007711	Unfortunately, due to the age of the building, the floor boards have seen quite a lot of traffic and therefore are very creaky.	
3270301	50007134	The location is quite good and in very short walking distance from some fabulous little cafe/ restaurants, which is where we ate, so I can't comment about Metropole meals.		80007712	All of the above will make a huge difference in terms of building noise for guests and we are very excited for the work to be completed.	
3270301	50007135	It's interesting reading multiple comments about train noise, we did hear trains occasionally but this wasn't the noise that bothered us....		80007713	I am sorry to hear that you had a skin reaction while staying here.	
3270301	50007136	the whole place is quite noisy.		80007714	Our housekeeping staff service all rooms daily and their stringent processes include thorough dusting and vacuuming, as well as the replacement of linen.	
3270301	50007137	The noise ranged from creaky stairs, heavy resounding footsteps along the hallway, from upstairs, and on the metal stairs outside our windows (which faced the inner courtyard).		80007715	The installation of new carpets will also have a happy side effect of significantly reducing the dust in the building.	
3270301	50007138	It sounded like people were moving furniture around upstairs!		80007716	We hope to see you again the next time you visit the Mountains.	
3270301	50007139	Conversations were clearly heard from people walking down the hallway and in the courtyard.		80007717	Regards, Shelley.	
3270301	50007140	The big downside of our courtyard-facing room was lack of privacy.				
3270301	50007141	People can quite clearly see into the room from the stairways in the courtyard, unless the curtains are closed (which makes the room very dark) or the frosted windows closed, which prevents ventilation (which the room was very much in need of).				
3270301	50007142	I suspect it would be very hot to stay in a courtyard-facing room if the days were hot - we had a cool weekend for our stay.				
3270301	50007143	We found the bathroom and the linen to be very clean but the bedroom was pretty dusty, which made my skin very itchy.				
3270301	50007144	I was very relieved to shower and checkout in the morning to get out of the room, which allowed my skin to settle down.				
3270301	50007145	The reception staff were friendly and professional and did make us feel welcome, it's a shame that the room was disappointing for the reasons mentioned above.				

3233097	50007150	Great stay!		80007728	Dear oziu77, Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time out to complete a review and share your thoughts with us.	
3233097	50007151	---SEP---		80007729	I am thrilled that you enjoyed your stay here with us at the Courtyard Lodges.	
3233097	50007152	We are very happy with stay in Parknasilla Resort.		80007730	They are an ideal option for those travelling in a group, providing that additional space while still enjoying all the facilities of the hotel.	
3233097	50007153	We stayed in lodge where was clean and we have everything what we needed (only toilet brushes are missing).		80007731	I am delighted that you and your children enjoyed the treasure trail, fairy trail and the play ground.	
3233097	50007154	Kids were very happy with playground and especially with Fairy Trail and PJ's Treasure Trail.		80007732	It is also wonderful to read that you are already planning your return visit.	
3233097	50007155	Great place to spend a time with kids!		80007733	Thank you again for your kind review and I look forward to welcoming you back in the future Warmest Regards Ruth O‚Äô Sullivan General Manager	
3233097	50007156	If You love to walk , You will be very happy with all trails and views.				
3233097	50007157	Definitely we will be back!				

3249423	50007160	SPECIAL MENTION		80007744	Dear Bryan M, Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach.	
3249423	50007161	TWO GREAT STAFF MEMBERS ---SEP---		80007745	We are proud that you chose our excellent location, just steps from Waikiki Beach and all the area attractions, for your special 22 night visit.	
3249423	50007162	I spent 22 nights in your hotel in July 2016.		80007746	We appreciate your special mentions of Jennifer and Leonida's excellent service and have shared these compliments with our team as further encouragement to keep up our Aloha spirit!	
3249423	50007163	Every one of your staff was pleasant and thoughtful.		80007747	We hope to have you back for many more enjoyable visits and wish you the very best in your travels.	
3249423	50007164	Each definitely demonstrated the aloha spirit.		80007748	Mahalo!	
3249423	50007165	I would like to make special mention of two of your staff who stood out as especially kind, friendly and helpful: #1 - Jennifer at the front desk who really made me feel welcome and special upon check in; and #2 - Leonida was part of your housekeeping staff on the 11th floor during my stay.				
3249423	50007166	My room was always immaculate, and when I chanced to see her in the hallway she always checked with me to make sure my room was in order and greeted me with alohas.				
3249423	50007167	I hope their kindness and professionalism can be recognized.				
3249423	50007168	Sincerely, Bryan Moyers.				

3281207	50007170	Easy Access to Melbourne CBD		80007759	Dear ldunn2017 Thank you for writing a review of your recent stay with us on trip advisor.	
3281207	50007171	---SEP--- Nice clean hotel.		80007760	I'm pleased to read that our central location in the CBD was convenient for your business needs and also to discover some of the delightful restaurants located close by, particularly on Hardware Lane.	
3281207	50007172	Check in and out were very easy and fast.		80007761	Our apartments offer great value for money and we provide an efficient friendly welcome and service to our valued guests.	
3281207	50007173	Good room service meal.		80007762	We look forward to seeing you again in the near future.	
3281207	50007174	Room was a little small, but it was a short stay and the price was reasonable so can't complain.		80007763	Regards, Dominic Graham Duty Manager	
3281207	50007175	Really convenient location for my business stay and for catching up with friends for a really nice meal close by.				

3232641	50007180	Good but could be Great!		80007774	Thank you for your constructive feedback concerning our Club Lounge.	
3232641	50007181	---SEP---		80007775	We definitely want our guests who choose this upgrade to feel that there is value to the Club level experience, so we will consider your feedback carefully.	
3232641	50007182	This location is close to the downtown convention center.		80007776	Thank you so much for taking the time to let us know about it.	
3232641	50007183	The rooms we stayed in was in the club level.		80007777	Your feedback will allow us to improve and to get better and for that, we are grateful to you.	
3232641	50007184	But for the extra money there was only the very basic items in the club lounge.		80007778	It was also gratifying to know that your overall experience here was a good one and that you found our location to be so convenient to the convention center.	
3232641	50007185	A cold breakfast selection of cut fruit, cereal or oatmeal, toast or pastry, hard boiled egg.		80007779	We hope you will choose to come back and visit again and next time that your experience will be a GREAT one.	
3232641	50007186	Afternoon picks were uninviting and bland also.		80007780	Warm regards, Rooms Management	
3232641	50007187	I recommend to the hotel to upgrade the selections because you are receiving more for those rooms, provide more to the clients who are willing to pay for the upgraded rooms!				
3232641	50007188	That being said if your going to stay downtown Phoenix, this is a GOOD place.				

3317823	50007190	Pleasant surprise ---SEP--- Pleasant surprise after reading mixed bag of reviews.		80007791	Thank you for your kind comments, As you say it alwaysa pays for you to book direct with us rather than using a booking agent if you want to save money.	
3317823	50007191	Had a lovely two night stay.		80007792	Gordon Jowett M.D.	
3317823	50007192	Comfortable, clean room with plentiful supply of tea, coffee, hot choc and biscuits.				
3317823	50007193	Friendly helpful staff, nice buffet style breakfast and only 15 mins drive into Leeds.				
3317823	50007194	A lot better value than staying in the city itself and cheaper still if you book directly through hotel rather than one of the third party offers.				
3317823	50007195	Was offered further discount when I got to the hotel as I was staying on my own, which was a nice surprise.				
3317823	50007196	Def recommend and will definitely be staying again.				
3317823	50007197	Thank you ‚ò∫				

3319167	50007200	Excellent value ---SEP--- Stayed at the Ibis for two nights in July 2010 whilst attending a wedding in Belfast.		80007803	Dear Edesia5, Many thanks for the positive comments, I‚Äôm happy we were able to make your stay with us so enjoyable.	
3319167	50007201	I mainly booked it because of the central location and its price and was pleasantly surprised.		80007804	I hope we can welcome you back to the Ibis Belfast again very soon.	
3319167	50007202	Staff were efficient and friendly and the facilities were all modern and clean.		80007805	Kind regards, Gaby Palazzini, General Manager.	
3319167	50007203	The rooms are very standard for this category of hotel, but again, everything was clean and working.				
3319167	50007204	"The bathroom ""pods"" were actually really nice and practical too."				
3319167	50007205	Would definitely stay again.				

3204452	50007210	Good hotel but great staff ---SEP---		80007816	Dear Tyson W, Thank you for much for reviewing your recent stay with us.	
3204452	50007211	Our flight was delayed and we were so late checking in - thanks jetstar!		80007817	I am so pleased to hear that Patrick was able to help you with your bags and organise breakfast for the following day.	
3204452	50007212	But the guy at the desk Patrick was so helpful got us in quick and helped us with our bags up to the room and even gave us a cheap brekkie so we wouldnt be late for our plans the next day.		80007818	Our entire team work so hard to ensure our guests are enjoying their stays with us - feedback such as yours will only motivate them to continue providing this level of service.	
3204452	50007213	The room itself was nice enough and clean but not huge.		80007819	We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and hope that you choose to stay at Travelodge Docklands again soon!	
3204452	50007214	The hotel was close to the train and bus station so getting there was no drama.		80007820	Many thanks, Samantha Fabris (formerly Bluett)	
3204452	50007215	And close for us for the footy.		80007821	Assistant Hotel Manager	

3244812	50007220	great again ---SEP---		80007832	Many thanks for posting your comments.	
3244812	50007221	Second time I've stayed here.		80007833	We appreciate all feedback very much and the team and I look forward to welcoming you back at ibis budget Leeds.	
3244812	50007222	Its just right for a good night sleep.		80007834	Kind regards, S.Moss.	
3244812	50007223	Its quite basic but that's all I needed.				
3244812	50007224	Haven't tried the breakfast yet.				
3244812	50007225	Parking was a little far away but fine once you know the way.				

3242321	50007230	'Effective marketing conceals fundamental flaws' ---SEP--- Cable Beach is just one of those places that had been on my 'must do' list for some years.		80007845	Dear Nicholas S, Thank you for your comprehensive feedback.	
3242321	50007231	You've got to admire their marketing as it seems to have some sort of presence across a wide variety of social media and of course many WA Tourism brochures.		80007846	I'm very pleased you enjoyed most aspects of your stay and your recognition of our wonderful staff was most energizing indeed!	
3242321	50007232	Looking for a short break to celebrate my wife's birthday, Cable Beach therefore seemed an easy choice, so in late September we flew with Qantas up from Perth to explore this highly rated destination.		80007847	We will also certainly take on board your observations regarding those aspects you raise as in need of some attention, all were very useful observations, both well made and well taken, so thank you again!	
3242321	50007233	(this is the 'no frills' version of Qantas - pretty basic I have to say for our national carrier) Our pick-up from the airport was fast and efficient and the driver was most welcoming with an engaging commentary throughout the short journey from the airport to the resort.		80007848	Kind regards, Ron Sedon General Manager	
3242321	50007234	I guess we were unsure of what to expect, but upon arrival we could not help but make comparisons to places like Bali, which admittedly rather unfair, was always in the back of our minds.				
3242321	50007235	Cable Beach is not at all like Bali so don't expect that same wow factor you get in many of the Balinese properties.				
3242321	50007236	The reception process was quick and efficient and we were quickly in our room for the 4 night stay we had booked.				
3242321	50007237	We were told the rooms had recently been refurbished.				
3242321	50007238	Ours was simple, tidy, clean, but unremarkable.				
3242321	50007239	Our major disappointment was with the bed which felt like it had been slept in by a bunch of sumo wrestlers for about the past 10 years.				
3242321	50007240	It had a mind of its own leaning heavily to the right on one side and to the left on the other.				
3242321	50007241	In short, it was well past its 'best before date' and our sense was the mattress was not included in the refurbishment programme.				
3242321	50007242	We would recommend that it is!				
3242321	50007243	Otherwise the room was fine with good air-con and an excellent shower.				
3242321	50007244	The grounds of the hotel are quite spacious, well signed but (and again at the risk of making comparisons to Bali where labour comes much, much cheaper) the grounds themselves looked rather tired and in need of a good tidy up.				
3242321	50007245	There are three restaurants on site - they all look very good but we only ate at two of them.				
3242321	50007246	The Malaysian restaurant had good food but was spoilt by being served onto cold plates (admittedly a pet hate of mine) but which instantly killed the heat from the food.				
3242321	50007247	This is such a basic service error that it was frankly unforgivable and spoilt what was otherwise a well cooked and well presented meal.				
3242321	50007248	I suggest if you go here to request hot plates instead of them using the ones that was laid on the table hours earlier.				
3242321	50007249	The other fault with the Malaysian restaurant is that it is right alongside a children's playground which even at 8.30 in the evening was being used by small children and families.				
3242321	50007250	This is not conducive to a romantic dinner for two!				
3242321	50007251	Simply laying the tables so that one had one's back to the play area would have helped!				
3242321	50007252	(We moved it ourselves).				
3242321	50007253	However, I think they need to rethink that one.				
3242321	50007254	Some sort of screening would help.				
3242321	50007255	The main beach-front restaurant was much better.				
3242321	50007256	The evenings provided a pleasant environment and the food was quite excellent - as were the wait staff.				
3242321	50007257	Not cheap, but you would not expect it given the logistics and the distance from anywhere else, but more or less on a par with high-end Perth prices.				
3242321	50007258	The steak was some of the best we've ever had anywhere in the world.				
3242321	50007259	Breakfast is served in the same area but is a bit more of a 'bun fight' with what seemed like the whole resort arriving to eat at more or less the same time.				
3242321	50007260	However, the breakfast was plentiful and in the main, well presented although nothing unusual in the choice.				
3242321	50007261	Some operational issues let it down slightly such as the replenishment of serving trays, cold juices etc in situ (with staff pouring supermarket type plastic bottles of orange juice into the dispensers rather than taking them away to replenish in the kitchen area).				
3242321	50007262	It just seemed a bit sloppy somehow.				
3242321	50007263	But look, you get a good breakfast for $20 per head and that should keep you going for some time.				
3242321	50007264	We decided not to hire a car since we only had 4 days and it's a long drive to get anywhere - and the sealed roads go to tracks quite soon after leaving Broome.				
3242321	50007265	Be aware that if you hire a normal car you're not allowed to take it off surfaced roads so it all seems a bit pointless.				
3242321	50007266	There is a good free shuttle bus service into town or you can pay $4 to catch the town bus which stops directly outside the resort so you don't really need a car unless you want a 4WD and have the time to go off exploring.				
3242321	50007267	Avoid taking a taxi unless you want to re-mortgage your house, very expensive!				
3242321	50007268	Broome requires you to set your watch back about 50 years - rather quaint really, I sort of expected to see horses tied up outside the bars like in a cowboy movie.				
3242321	50007269	However, the pearl shops are excellent with huge choice and variety.				
3242321	50007270	Some really wonderful stuff and staff who are very well versed on everything to do with pearls.				
3242321	50007271	Meanwhile back at the resort, the adults only pool was really rather nice with its own bar with a good food menu too.				
3242321	50007272	My only gripe was that the cushions on the sun loungers need to visit the laundry more often.				
3242321	50007273	The staff were once again excellent so full marks to Cable Beach for their staff recruiting and training process.				
3242321	50007274	In summary, for young families, Cable Beach probably ticks a lot of the boxes.				
3242321	50007275	It's safe, there's enough to do, and the family pool should keep even the most stroppy 7 year old happy.				
3242321	50007276	For adults, well I guess its all about personal choice isn't it.				
3242321	50007277	For me, I think we would have got more for our money elsewhere but one has to remember the logistical cost of running a resort like this thousands of kilometres from the nearest civilisation.				
3242321	50007278	Would we go back?				
3242321	50007279	Probably not, but that's simply because we are so spoilt for choice living in WA, but look, why not give it a try.				
3242321	50007280	You might be one of the many who just love it and go back year after year.				
3242321	50007281	Enjoy!

3236161	50007293	apart from that its a magic place for a few days				

3302280	50007300	Great hotel and hospitality ---SEP---		80007872	Dear John P, Thank you for submitting a review about your three-day stay at the Loews Chicago Hotel.	
3302280	50007301	I stayed here for a 3 day conference.		80007873	We are glad to hear that you loved your time with us at the hotel and that you will be back to stay the next time you are in Chicago.	
3302280	50007302	The hotel was pristine clean and immaculate.		80007874	We look forward to it!	
3302280	50007303	The lobby is spacious and hip.		80007875	Many thanks, Christian Hansen General Manager Loews Chicago Hotel	
3302280	50007304	The furniture were unique and inviting.				
3302280	50007305	The front desk was very knowledge of the Chicago area place of interests.				
3302280	50007306	My room was awesome.				
3302280	50007307	The view from 7th floor was beautiful.				
3302280	50007308	They equipped the room with all the amenities that you would need (from a guy's perspective).				
3302280	50007309	The doorman and staff were very accommodating.				
3302280	50007310	Everyone was very helpful.				
3302280	50007311	I appreciate the attention my team				
3302280	50007312	and I received.				
3302280	50007313	There's a Starbucks next to the elevators (great location by the way) in the lobby.				
3302280	50007314	Great stay and will be back for sure.				

3312321	50007320	Lovely hotel and amazing Spa ---SEP--- Myself and my partner have stayed here on a couple of occasions over the past 18 months.		80007886	Dear KarenStorie85	
3312321	50007321	The hotel is beautiful.		80007887	Thank you for your lovely Trip Advisor Review and indeed your loyalty to Farnham Estate!	
3312321	50007322	Both times we have received a modern room which is very comfy.		80007888	It's great to read such lovely feedback and myself and the team really appreciate it.	
3312321	50007323	Best bit of the trip - the spa!		80007889	I do hope that you will get the chance to visit us again soon and we certainly look forward to welcoming you back.	
3312321	50007324	Pool is lovely and it's great being able to access the outdoor poor without every leaving the indoor pool, very romantic when you get this to yourself.		80007890	Kind regards Andrew Drysdale General Manager	
3312321	50007325	The different areas in the spa are well kept and have never been busy when we were there which is another plus.				
3312321	50007326	Dinner is a bit pricey in restaurant but we ate in the bar one night and enjoyed the great atmosphere.				
3312321	50007327	Cannot wait to visit again early next year.				

3220338	50007330	Wotif - Awesome last minute find!!!		80007901	Thanks for the feedback - yes, we are very proud of our team (and Taranaki).	
3220338	50007331	---SEP---		80007902	Hope to see you and the family back soon.	
3220338	50007332	What a beautiful hotel - given we booked a few hours before arriving, I must say I was extremely impressed with everything.		80007903	Kind regards, Peter & Rosemary Tennent	
3220338	50007333	The well layout room and modernised look, it was a real score!				
3220338	50007334	The character of the whole Hotel flowed well throughout.				
3220338	50007335	We checked in 2 Adults and 2 kids, this Hotel definitely services Families and Corporate Business travellers, there aren't many places that can pull that off.				
3220338	50007336	The atmosphere was friendly, staff we passed were were smiley and the whole vibe of the hotel was beautiful.				
3220338	50007337	We too made use of the basketball hoop, pool and absolutely LOVED that even the little things like Toothbrush/paste and comb were thought of!!!				
3220338	50007338	For the price we scored (thank you WOTIF) we were highly impressed and without a doubt this will remain to be our first preference given we will be regular visitors to New Plymouth with husband working at the Taranaki hospital over the next 6-12 months, this is perfect for our family!				
3220338	50007339	With the Buffet Restaurant, pool and Basketball available why would you want to go anywhere else.				
3220338	50007340	Well done to the Hosts Peter and Rosemary Tennent, you must be proud of this Paradise!				
3220338	50007341	Its been a long time since I've been wowed in any of my Reviews, this is certainly a WOW moment, especially for the fantastic cheap price we found on WOTIF :-)				

3313603	50007350	Very convenient for the airport terminal.		80007914	Dear Drew, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.	
3313603	50007351	---SEP---		80007915	I am delighted you enjoy staying with us and appreciate your loyalty and business over the years.	
3313603	50007352	We always stay if taking late or early flights, and have done so since their Great Southern days.		80007916	There are not many people who still know us as a Great Southern!	
3313603	50007353	"It is beginning to look a little ""tired"" now, but it is comfortable, extremely convenient, and the staff are always charming, friendly and very helpful."		80007917	We appreciate all of your feedback and we look forward to seeing you again.	
3313603	50007354	Excellent breakfasts, and the parking is cheaper than using the airport's car parks.		80007918	Kind Regards	
3313603	50007355	They have a free shuttle service for the few hundred metres to/from the terminal.				
3313603	50007356	Recommend.				

3224869	50007360	What can you say about this amazing castle in the mountains?		80007929	Thank you for visiting from Indiana and for taking the time to share your positive experience, especially the warm and engaging service you enjoyed.	
3224869	50007361	---SEP---		80007930	We are delighted that you had a nice time and we certainly hope you can come back if your travels bring you to The Canadian Rockies again.	
3224869	50007362	The best part about this resort is just seeing this resort.		80007931	The Fairmont Banff Springs	
3224869	50007363	I can think of no other resort where the outside of it is so captivating.				
3224869	50007364	We specifically drove to an overlook so we could get another view of the hotel.				
3224869	50007365	Then the best thing about the hotel is the view.				
3224869	50007366	Amazing views.				
3224869	50007367	We stayed in the Stanley Thompson Wing.				
3224869	50007368	Our room did not have a view.				
3224869	50007369	I was disappointed in that, but I have to say that the room itself made up for the lack of view.				
3224869	50007370	Plenty of space, gorgeous and spacious bathroom.				
3224869	50007371	The seating area was comfortable.				
3224869	50007372	We had a fireplace...only for looks...it was not a working fireplace.				
3224869	50007373	The large screen television was an unexpected plus for viewing the Super Bowl.				
3224869	50007374	The third best thing about the resort would have to be the service.				
3224869	50007375	Perhaps Canadians are known for their service (I have been overly impressed everywhere I have gone), but this resort must pride themselves on their outstanding service.				
3224869	50007376	Everyone seemed determined to be helpful.				
3224869	50007377	So many smiles!				
3224869	50007378	I will remember this the most.				
3224869	50007379	Great service.				
3224869	50007380	Finally, the interior is worth a visit all on its own.				
3224869	50007381	It is a castle.				
3224869	50007382	There is a rich history at this resort.				
3224869	50007383	Fun, fun place.				
3224869	50007384	I would imagine the summer months are even better!				

3201411	50007390	disappointing!		80007942	Many thanks for submitting your review.	
3201411	50007391	---SEP---		80007943	We understand that your overall experience was not exceptional and we do apologise for this.	
3201411	50007392	Beautiful city but a lack of cleanliness in our room marred our stay for the amount of money we paid just to sleep it was a big disappointment!!staff at reception was pleasant enough unlike the smokers hanging around the entrance!		80007944	We‚Äôll be sure to pass your valuable feedback directly to our colleagues in our hotel as this is the best way for us to improve the service we offer.	
3201411				80007945	Thank you again for your review.	

3252633	50007400	great location staff friendly excellent service nice clean rooms the restaurant very relaxing enjoyable great food ---SEP--- the pool was great also gym the hotel room clean good size nice shower.		80007956	Aloha!

3252633	50007402	no resort fee which is a bonus people may need to be aware of this compare to other hotels great saving .				
3252633	50007403	we will be back they set a very high standard a perfect stay at a perfect place .				

3279248	50007410	OTT!!!		80007968	We appreciate your review of Marriott‚Äôs Canyon Villas.	
3279248	50007411	---SEP---		80007969	We are happy to hear that you are proud owners at the resort and enjoyed your recent stay.	
3279248	50007412	We own here so maybe biased		80007970	We look forward to seeing you next time in Phoenix!	
3279248	50007413	but it is one of our favorite Marriotts (other is Custom House, Boston).				
3279248	50007414	Many of the staff here know us and we believe that is a plus. 30 minutes from Sly Harbor and easy drive/shuttle.				
3279248	50007415	Recently redecorated and very nice.				

3215152	50007420	Dirty floor tile grout and mold around bath tub ---SEP---		80007981	Dear jimmy9584, Thank you for choosing to stay with us at Meriton Serviced Apartments on Kent Street!	
3215152	50007421	The unit is very roomy with sitting, dining areas completed with kitchen and all utilities.		80007982	We value our guests‚Äô feedback	
3215152	50007422	The dirty floor tile grout in the dining and sitting area did not please me at all.		80007983	so we appreciate you taking your time to share your experiences with us.	
3215152	50007423	Worst part, there was mold around the bath tub.		80007984	At Meriton Serviced Apartments, we certainly do provide spacious suites, those much larger than a typical hotel room and inclusive of a gourmet kitchen, so we‚Äôre delighted you found them of use throughout your stay.	
3215152	50007424	Other things were OK, nothing particularly special, location was very good.		80007985	Please be assured that your comments have been taken on board.	
3215152	50007425	We paid Aus$246/night, which was kind of expensive, in my opinion it should have been $150 the most.		80007986	As mentioned, we do greatly value our guests‚Äô feedback so remarks like yours will only help us to improve on our quality of service.	
3215152				80007987	jimmy9584, we do hope to be able to welcome you back to Meriton Serviced Apartments sometime in the not so distant future, where we can showcase our usually high standard of service to yourself and your family.	
3215152				80007988	Kind Regards, Amanda H Online Reputation Team	

3176390	50007430	Great Hotel ---SEP--- Excellent karate trip to bath made more special by the great Holiday Inn we stayed at.		80007999	Dear guest, thank you for this great review for our hotel!	
3176390	50007431	Exceptional staff and a lovely clean hotel throughout.		80008000	I'm vert glad you had such a pleasant stay with us and found our common areas so clean and nice.	
3176390	50007432	Love the restful lounge and the breakfast policy is ideal.		80008001	I'm also glad you pointed out our free breakfast, which has recently been added new features to, and hope we'll be able to see you again soon!	
3176390	50007433	Will def go back!		80008002	Kindly, David	
3176390	50007434	Oss!				

3304282	50007440	A Seniors View of their Stay ---SEP--- Being on a Seniors' Special rate we did not expect one of their better rooms.		80008013	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your recent visit.	
3304282	50007441	We have stayed at this venue once a year for 6 years.		80008014	I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed the facilities as well as our great location.	
3304282	50007442	Our room was in the old section and was large, comfortable, clean and everything worked.		80008015	Reservations for Stefano‚Äôs restaurant can now be made via a direct line to their office or on their website.	
3304282	50007443	The reception staff were pleasant and helpful.		80008016	Our Reception staff will also happily coordinate bookings if you wish to arrange accommodation & dining reservations at once.	
3304282	50007444	The buffet breakfast in the beautiful old dining room , which was included in the tariff, was very good with a reasonable array of fruits, cereals etc available.		80008017	We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future and thank you again for your feedback.	
3304282	50007445	It's proximity to the railway station and bus stops are very convenient.		80008018	Warm regards, Kelly Williams General Manager	
3304282	50007446	"The one ""problem"" since the management change is the inability to organise, with one phone call, a room and Stefanos Restaurant package as was possibly previously."				

3180131	50007450	Not a bad hotel - but could do with a facelift ---SEP---		80008029	Dear Lou M, Thank you for taking the time to write your comments following your recent stay with us and I am sorry to read of your disappointments about the hotel.	
3180131	50007451	I booked the King Deluxe Plus rooms for our stay.		80008030	We have over the last two years refurbished over 50% of our bedrooms and are presently completing the replacement of all the windows within the non- sea facing bedrooms.	
3180131	50007452	(Don't be fooled by a so called 'flash sale'.		80008031	We have also commenced the repainting of all our bedroom corridors and a further number of bedrooms will be refurbished in 2013, your comments regarding the cleanliness of the room been shared with my Rooms Divisions Manager.	
3180131	50007453	The price of this room - and all their others - increased during that period and went down again afterwards!)		80008032	However I am delighted you enjoyed our Hilton breakfast as we do get a lot of very positive comments on it.	
3180131	50007454	Really huge room with lots of space and a 6 foot wide bed which was awesome and very comfortable.		80008033	Once again, thank you for your comments and we hope to see you back in the near future.	
3180131	50007455	Big wide screen TV and a mini bar fridge (empty though).		80008034	Kind regards Guy	
3180131	50007456	Teas and coffee but no hot chocolate in the room.				
3180131	50007457	Small shortbread biscuits.				
3180131	50007458	Floor to celing black out curtains - always a plus!				
3180131	50007459	The bathroom was average.				
3180131	50007460	I had thought the bathroom would be a bit larger and nicer in tune with the room.				
3180131	50007461	Also the toilet needed flushing when we arrived - I assume the yellow/grey smelly stuff had seeped back up the pipe.				
3180131	50007462	Perhaps the room had not been used in a while?				
3180131	50007463	Also quite dusty in places.				
3180131	50007464	The toiletries were fine if a bit small, but empty bottles were replaced so that was good.				
3180131	50007465	The windows were filthy dirty and we could barely see through them - although all to see was mounds of bird poo.				
3180131	50007466	They really need to get a window cleaner.				
3180131	50007467	The lights were a bit odd.				
3180131	50007468	I couldn't get the desk light to work without the hall light being on too, which is a pain when there is someone else still trying to sleep.				
3180131	50007469	Breakfast was brilliant as it always is in a Hilton so no surprises there.				
3180131	50007470	Everything you could want and a chef cooking things to order too.				
3180131	50007471	Bar prices are absolutely extortionate - don't even bother.				
3180131	50007472	¬£9 for a cocktail?				
3180131	50007473	Seriously?				
3180131	50007474	We tried out the swimming pool/spa.				
3180131	50007475	The changing rooms were all wet with bits all over the floor.				
3180131	50007476	Not terribly pleasant.				
3180131	50007477	The Hot Tub had loads of foam on it (this is basically body oils and general waste from peoples bodies where the spa hasn't been maintained properly) so we gave that a miss!				
3180131	50007478	The swimming pool was ok but a bit stingy on the eyes (again this is where there is not enough Free Chlorine in the water and too much Combined (used up)				
3180131	50007479	Chlorine, which is what causes problems and irritation.				
3180131	50007480	(Somewhat ironic as we were attending the annual pool and spa show that this hotel has hosted for the last 17 years - clearly they haven't learnt anything.				
3180131	50007481	My colleagues said it was the same last year too!)				
3180131	50007482	Overall it's not a bad place to stay but it is looking tired in places and could do with a bit of work.				

3189346	50007490	Threw away my left items ---SEP---		80008045	We appreciate the comments, especially with regards to your opinion of our room.	
3189346	50007491	I stayed there for 3 days .		80008046	Please consider staying with us again so that we can have the opportunity to provide you with an even superior experience.	
3189346	50007492	My room was not cleaned as they told me they only are there for 5 hours during a time i needed to work.				
3189346	50007493	I left my dental retainers and called the next morning when I relaized .				
3189346	50007494	I was told hey had them and when I went to have them picked up, was told they were thrown away.				
3189346	50007495	I now have to spend 600 dollars .

3293186	50007512	After a extremely stressful travel day Thanks to Air Canada, we had outstanding customer service provided by the Fairmont's night manager!		80008062	I will ensure she receives your accolades.	
3293186	50007513	She went above and beyond for us!		80008063	Thank you for sharing your feedback and we hope we can welcome you again, but under much better circumstances next time!	
3293186	50007514	Honestly just her pleasantness alone helped ease our more than disastrous day!		80008064	Warm regards, Patrick Gosselin General Manager	
3293186	50007515	Thank you so much!!!

3300460	50007530	Dirty ---SEP--- Old rooms.		80008091	SkyHighTahoe, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us.	
3300460	50007531	Terrible elevators.		80008092	I am sorry to hear your experience was anything less than satisfactory for you.	
3300460	50007532	Room smelled like cleaner and poop.		80008093	I will be sure to share your feedback with our team members to address the odd smell you experienced as that is not acceptable for any guest to be subjected to-	
3300460	50007533	Expensive for a garden inn.		80008094	I am terribly sorry you were.	
3300460	50007534	Breakfast was decent.		80008095	We realize you have many choices in the area and we appreciate the opportunity to host you- we hope we are afforded a second chance to win back your business should your travels bring you back to the area.

3300460	50007537	Much nicer.				

3190952	50007540	Great customer care ---SEP---		80008107	Dear Anthony, Thanks for taking the time to share your positive feedback, it means a lot to my team and I. It means a lot to the team and I to know our hard works pays off!	
3190952	50007541	We had an initial issue due to breakdown in communication about parking - we arrived on rugby world cup Sunday to find hotel parking full, also usual two overflow car parks full ended up parking some distance away and having to carry luggage almost half a mile - complained to manager who upgraded us to business class room with free breakfast :		80008108	Thanks so much for the great feedback.	
3190952	50007542	some communication issues as staff not England but got there eventually - overall enjoyable stay		80008109	Kind Regards, Sameer Gangoli Front Office Manager	

3287438	50007550	Loveliest relaxing break ---SEP--- Just returned from the most relaxing 3 night break.		80008110	Dear Reviewer.	
3287438	50007551	It was our first visit to the hotel.		80008111	Thank you for your review and I am pleased to read your positive comments regarding food, service and the Kid's Club.	
3287438	50007552	We were checked in by lovely, helpful and pleasant staff.		80008112	I look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back to the Slieve Russell in the future.	
3287438	50007553	The reception and foyer area is beautiful and spacious.		80008113	Kind regards, Tony Walker.	
3287438	50007554	We loved to sit and watch the world go by here, with a coffee.				
3287438	50007555	Our room was good - yes, we have had more spacious family rooms in other hotels, but it was perfectly adequate.				
3287438	50007556	Two wee issues were finding a bottle of water at the side of the bed from previous guests and also the fridge didn't work.				
3287438	50007557	However, the room was kept clean and housekeeping were kind to provide us couple more cups and milk one evening.				
3287438	50007558	(We were left one packet of shortbread but between 5 of us, we then requested more)				
3287438	50007559	The hotels kids club is great!				
3287438	50007560	Kids can eat their dinner with all the other kids at 5pm, however our 2 youngest kids weren't keen as the kids were all only aged 4-7 thereabouts.				
3287438	50007561	However, we do realize the average age can change.				
3287438	50007562	A wee tip would be to maybe have a separate group for kids from aged 10/11 to 15?				
3287438	50007563	Snooker competitions, water volleyball etc etc.. I realize may be difficult to coordinate having two different groups, but would be good for Halloween.				
3287438	50007564	Hint hint !!				
3287438	50007565	The food in setanta restaurant was top notch!				
3287438	50007566	Absolutely delicious.				
3287438	50007567	We ate also in Kells bar - also delicious.				
3287438	50007568	Staff are so helpful and friendly.				
3287438	50007569	Pool is a great size - was confused as to why so much sand at bottom of pool, but we got used to it.				
3287438	50007570	Ladies shower area was always full of hair-				
3287438	50007571	I know this can just be the fault of lazy folk who don't bother to clean up after themselves, and no fault of the staff who do seem to check on changing rooms regularly.				
3287438	50007572	Breakfast was super - everything very fresh and beautiful.				
3287438	50007573	We will certainly return soon.				

3221586	50007580	Friendly, Helpful Staff with Comfy Rooms ---SEP---		80008124	Hi Sandy0167, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience of the Hilton Dublin Airport.	
3221586	50007581	The staff at the Hilton Dublin Airport go out of their way to make you feel special.		80008125	It's lovely to hear you have enjoyed your stay with us and I am delighted the team looked after you & made you feel special during your time at the hotel.	
3221586	50007582	From the complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel, to storing baggage while we took a few days to visit London, they made us feel like true guests.		80008126	We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel again soon & please do not hesitate to book direct with us to enjoy our great rates.	
3221586	50007583	I would definitely stay here again.		80008127	Kind regards, Chris Douglas General Manager	

3200560	50007590	Good & Bad ---SEP---		80008138	Thanks for your feedback.	
3200560	50007591	Sundeck was an interesting experience of Australian snow culture.		80008139	Extensive maintenance is done on the hotel every summer.	
3200560	50007592	Yes it has a great location, awesome food and a solid drying room		80008140	Seems like it might be time to replace the hair dryers.	
3200560	50007593	but there is so much that could be better - especially for the inflated prices!				
3200560	50007594	It felt like the owners are using the nostalgia that this is an old school ski lodge as an excuse to do any significant work on the place.				
3200560	50007595	Our room was noisy from the cracks in the walls & the gaps in the windows.				
3200560	50007596	Everything in the rooms is old - like 30 years old.				
3200560	50007597	I even asked for a hair dryer - fairly run of the mill when you are paying over $500 a night - and the one I was handed was a tiny travel dryer that had definitely seen better days - and it caught on fire when I turned it on.				
3200560	50007598	I don't know if I would return, as a weekend here is about the same as a weekend in NZ.				
3200560	50007599	Perisher as a whole is way too over priced ..... especially with it's sub par access, long lift lines, mediocre lifts, and tracked out terrain.				

3318144	50007600	Amazing view, Beautiful accommodation ---SEP--- Had an amazing stay here.		80008151	Thank you for your feedback regarding you stay with us in September 2013.	
3318144	50007601	We stayed during September 2013,		80008152	We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay in our Apartments and appreciate your comments regarding the room.	
3318144	50007602	so yes I do know that this review is well overdue :) .		80008153	The hotel does offer an in room movie selection that can be purchased through our TV system and this is the reason that we do not offer DVD players in our Apartments.	
3318144	50007603	What a absolute beautiful stay we had.		80008154	We would love to welcome you back to the hotel in the future and please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you are back in our wonderful destination.	
3318144	50007604	The staff are wonderful, helpful, efficient and friendly.		80008155	Kind regards Jackie Guiney Hotel Manager Copthorne Hotel & Apartments Queenstown Lakeview	
3318144	50007605	We stayed in a two bedroom apartment, 2 floors, the rooms were upstairs with the main bedroom having an ensuite and balcony, and the second bedroom although we had requested a double bed when we booked, which had been confirmed with an email unfortunately had 2 single beds instead.				
3318144	50007606	Thankfully the person staying in the room wasn't too upset about it, so we didn't mention it to the staff.				
3318144	50007607	The kitchen was well equipped.				
3318144	50007608	Comfortable lounge the only small complaint it would've be great if they had a DVD player, due to wet weather we were stuck inside for a day and would've liked to of been able to watch a DVD.				
3318144	50007609	Not really a complaint just would've been a nice option for bad weather.				
3318144	50007610	The best thing about the Copthorne is the view.				
3318144	50007611	Wow amazing, beautiful views of the lake and the mountains, we were lucky enough to see the snow on top of the mountains as our last night there it decided to snow.				
3318144	50007612	Even in the wet weather we would still go out on the balcony and stare at the view.				
3318144	50007613	The Copthorne is situated quite close to town, airport and shops.				
3318144	50007614	If you get a chance take the steamboat TSS.				
3318144	50007615	Earnslaw over to Walter Peak Farm.				
3318144	50007616	Great day out.				
3318144	50007617	The front desk at the Copthorne is more than happy to organise it for you, including transfers there if needed.				
3318144	50007618	When we decide on another trip to Queenstown we will definitely stay at the Copthorne again.				
3318144	50007619	Thanks Copthorne for an amazing stay :)				

3242662	50007620	All ways enjoy :)		80008166	Thank you for your review and comments about your stay.	
3242662	50007621	---SEP---		80008167	It is lovely to hear that you enjoy staying at Oaks M on Palmer and that the property is located in a perfect position for your needs.	
3242662	50007622	I have stayed at Oaks on palmer many times in the past on visiting Townsville .		80008168	We appreciate your loyalty towards our hotel and hope to welcome you back once again soon.	
3242662	50007623	Have all ways found the staff helpful & frendly & The rooms are moden & clean .				
3242662	50007624	I recomend that if you want a quite room you ask for a room on a higher level as there is a backpackers at the rear of oaks & can some times get a bit roudy .				
3242662	50007625	but all in all it is a nice spot to stay as it also is close to good restaruants & clubs & a hop & a skip away from most boat & island trips .				

3177738	50007630	Friendly staff but hotel needs updating ---SEP--- Stayed here in April 2013 for four nights.		80008179	Thank you for your feedback.	
3177738	50007631	The hotel is conveniently situated on the intercoastal waterway on a water taxi stop and is a few blocks from the beach.		80008180	Guest room renovations are in full swing, with dining chairs already installed, we‚Äôre almost finished with new carpet and the sofa beds are being installed as we speak.	
3177738	50007632	There is also a large mall next door as well as a grocery and drug store across the street.		80008181	I will mention the condition of the balcony to our housekeeping team.	
3177738	50007633	While the staff was very friendly, the guest rooms are in need of updating.		80008182	Parking is very limited in the area so we offer valet parking at a competitive rate.	
3177738	50007634	The suite we stayed in was very spacious, however the chairs in the dining area were all peeling and looked shabby and the couch was extremely worn down.		80008183	I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the location, our lobby & patio area, and also the pool bar.	
3177738	50007635	The patio had some sad furniture and our patio also had several old cigarette butts scattered throughout.		80008184	We hope that next time you‚Äôre in the area you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations of our hotel.	
3177738	50007636	Aside from the space given in the room, I did not feel that it was worth the $169/night rate.		80008185	John Allan Hotel Manager	
3177738	50007637	Additionally, if you are bringing a car, they charge a mandatory $25/day valet fee (there is no lot available to park your own car...however there were a few vacant other lots right next to the hotel that were chained off).				
3177738	50007638	The lobby and patio area were all very nice and the outdoor bar was a nice place to relax.				
3177738	50007639	We didn't end up using the pool but feedback from others is that the pool was kept very warm, so that did not leave us with much desire to use the pool.				
3177738	50007640	As I said before, the staff was all very friendly.				
3177738	50007641	I can't say I would stay here again.				

3209086	50007650	Almost ---SEP--- Stayed here with a baby.		80008196	Dear Sarah, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.	
3209086	50007651	A nice hotel but many things could be improved.		80008197	While I wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve.	
3209086	50007652	Breakfast buffet definitely not worth the money given there are so many great cafes a short walk from the hotel.		80008198	We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short.	
3209086	50007653	They could really lift their game.		80008199	If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.	
3209086	50007654	Hard bacon, cold fried foods and Batista coffee extra $5.		80008200	Sincerely, Abby McDowell Marketing Manager	
3209086	50007655	The room was a disabled room with large bathroom however many disabled person would struggle with the bath.				
3209086	50007656	The service at reception was friendly but needed multiple attempts to get card access correct and provide replacement card which left me sitting in dark room one evening for 2 hrs before a card to activate lights was delivered(unable to leave room due to baby).				
3209086	50007657	I looked forward to staying here and was a little dissapointed but was still a pleasant stay.				

3234460	50007660	Christmas just the way we like it!		80008211	Hi Rob, Thank you for such a positive review and for being a loyal guest.	
3234460	50007661	---SEP---		80008212	I am delighted that you enjoyed another Christmas with us.	
3234460	50007662	We have spent several Christmas holidays with LBL.		80008213	We have yet to complete all our year end projects this year, however when we do, we are going to have a contest where the guest who can list the most changes and additions, recently completed, will win a fabulous prize.	
3234460	50007663	Everything about the experience satisfies and often exceeds our expectations.		80008214	Details will be announced in a future newsletter.	
3234460	50007664	The food is good---the service warm and friendly and the rooms are cozy and comfortable.		80008215	My very best wishes, for the New Year.	
3234460	50007665	The recent renovations/changes---we counted ten since last year---are wonderful and we look forward to seeing what else has been achieved in our next visit.		80008216	Tim Hackett

3184560	50007680	Great meeting rooms.		80008244	Thank you so much for posting your review.	
3184560	50007681	Hotel rooms ok ---SEP--- Nice Lobby, restaurant and meeting rooms.		80008245	Seems as if you enjoyed your stay except for the cleanliness issues.	
3184560	50007682	Hotel rooms could be updated with cleaner bathrooms and carpet.		80008246	I will share with my entire team as this is not the norm for us.	
3184560	50007683	Outside bar and being on intercostal is nice.		80008247	Thank you once again and we do hope to see you again soon!	
3184560	50007684	If you up to a walk beach is not too far.				
3184560	50007685	Shopping is great.				
3184560	50007686	Right next door to hotel with macys, Neiman Marcus and Dillards				

3325964	50007690	Stay away from this hotel ---SEP---		80008258	Aloha and thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel.	
3325964	50007691	We stayed at this hotel for our 45th wedding anniversary.		80008259	We sincerely appreciate criticism as well as praise for our employees, as we can grow and learn from guest feedback.	
3325964	50007692	What a mistake!		80008260	I am surprised that you had issues with our elevator system.	
3325964	50007693	We had an ocean front roomand the view and room were great		80008261	Since the system became fully operational in December, 2010, our wait times for elevators (even in the mornings when it is indeed busy) have been minimal.	
3325964	50007694	but thats where it ends.		80008262	We can track our wait times as everything is now computerized and recorded.	
3325964	50007695	The elevators are a nightmare.		80008263	During the month of March, we have not seen excessive wait times.	
3325964	50007696	They are SLOW and in the mornings during the breakfast don't even work at all.		80008264	We also encourage guests to report excessive noise as well as smoking violations to the Front Desk as soon as they observe or experience them.	
3325964	50007697	Considering we were on the 17th floor this was not fun.		80008265	We will room move guests iif at all possible, and will immediately work with challenging guests as well.	
3325964	50007698	Walking up 17 floors is not my idea of a good time.		80008266	Our Security Officers will respond promptly.	
3325964	50007699	The noise from the next room started at about 1 am every morning and went until at least 4 am every day we were there.		80008267	Mark Demello General Manager	
3325964	50007700	I complained twice and at checkout and all I got was let it know if it happens again.				
3325964	50007701	This is also a non-smoking hotel and they were doing that also.				
3325964	50007702	We slept with our patio door open to get the oocean breezes but had to close the door because of the smell.				
3325964	50007703	Also complained about that and I was told that housekkeping would check for signs of smoking				
3325964	50007704	but it happened again the next night.				
3325964	50007705	I paid close to $200 a night for this room and was there for 6 nights and 5 of the nights thhis went on every night with no action on the hotels part to correct the problem.				
3325964	50007706	Definitely don't stay here!				
3325964	50007707	I also returned their customer satisfaction email and got a rely from them saying they would forward to that hotel and that they hoped to see us again.				
3325964	50007708	That won't be happening@				

3306481	50007710	Great room with a view ---SEP---		80008278	Thankyou for choosing The Copperstone for your holiday destination.	
3306481	50007711	We had a great room at the back of the hotel with a view the mountain.		80008279	We are very glad to hear you enjoyed the facilities and all The Resort has to offer.	
3306481	50007712	The room was 2 levels.		80008280	it would be our pleasure to see you again for another enjoyable stay!

3188645	50007725	WORST PART: Had some issues getting the bathroom sink faucet fixed; it took two work order requests.		80008297	Warm Regards, Tiffany Ramos Sales Manager	
3188645	50007726	Also asked about the bathroom fan being caked with dust, but it didn't seem to be of any concern because it was left alone.				
3188645	50007727	Mike at the front desk gave an amazing welcome.				
3188645	50007728	My housekeeper showed of her great smile in the hallway, and the girl who managed the gatehouse/breakfast made me feel like we'd been long time friends.				
3188645	50007729	All-in-all, this was definitely worth the value.				

3287988	50007730	Smart modern hotel great staff & parking ---SEP--- Courteous counter staff.		80008308	Dear Col A: Thank you very much choosing Potters Boutique Hotel for your time in Toowoomba and for taking the time to share your wonderful experience with us.

3230035	50007770	Nice surprise ---SEP--- Built in the late 1800's did not realize the history they had to offer.		80008363	Dear machandler82, Thank you for joining us at The Brown Palace Hotel and Spa.	
3230035	50007771	Nice little coffe shop but hours are to short.		80008364	Our establishment has such an amazing history and we are thrilled to share it with each and every guest.	
3230035	50007772	Not far to walk to other places to eat.		80008365	We appreciate your feedback regarding the service and have shared your review with the appropriate departments.	
3230035	50007773	Room was good watch that step up into the restroom especially in the middle of the night.		80008366	Warm regards, Managing Director	
3230035	50007774	Cleaning staf only did the minimum to clean while we were there, staff was really nice parking is a bit difficult so use the valet.				

3193864	50007780	Excellent Location!		80008377	Aloha JaniseM19, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your review.	
3193864	50007781	---SEP--- Clean room, nothing special, had to change rooms next day for bed preference; front desk played dumb first day we arrived and did not mention completing a card for preference type so they could call us next day.		80008378	We are sorry that we were unable to accommodate your bedding request for your first night, but are glad you were given a room move.	
3193864	50007782	Housekeeping staff was exceptional.		80008379	We regret any confusion regarding your reservation.	
3193864	50007783	I had to go to desk and ask if there was a room change even available.		80008380	Our room categories are based on ocean views, and not beds We make every effort to meet requests, but this is sometimes challenging during high occupancy.	
3193864	50007784	Tiki Bar food was good but pricey and make sure you go at happy hour otherwise like all other establishments the drinks are expensive.		80008381	Thank you for your kind words about our excellent Housekeeping Team!	
3193864				80008382	It's great that you liked our premier Waikiki location, as well.

3326593	50007790	The Grand Windsor Hotel ---SEP---		80008395	Dear Mr / Ms Schoemaker, Wonderful news!	
3326593	50007791	This was a totally luxe experience.		80008396	Thanking you for your kind words.	
3326593	50007792	From checkin to when we left two days later, the staff could not have been more attentive.		80008397	The pleasure of your company was ours and we thank you for your recommendation to readers.	
3326593	50007793	Our room, with seperate sitting room, was spacious with classical style furniture and a really comfortable bed.		80008398	Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you both back already.

3253801	50007800	Great Hosts ---SEP---		80008400	It was a pleasure having you both stay with us and we are pleased you enjoyed yourselves and thank you for such a lovely review.	
3253801	50007801	My wife and i have just had the pleasure of staying at one of the best B&B's that we have stayed in for a very long time over the Easter break.		80008401	Hope to see you both back at Hall Park in the not too distant future.	
3253801	50007802	Jane and Dick were lovely hosts and very helpful, their home / B&B is spotless and very comfortable, the gardens stunning, work in progress, as for breakfast lovely fresh farm produce well cooked, but the best bit for me was the bread which Jane makes she holds bread making courses at certain times through out the year.		80008402	Jane	
3253801	50007803	i highly recommend this B&B don't be put off by the fact that it seems a way out side Norwich as the bus stop is just outside the B&B and just takes 10 mins you are only mins from the Broads, the B&B is reasonably priced as well.				
3253801	50007804	Thanks for the lovely stay.				

3299598	50007810	Best hotel in Waikiki ---SEP---		80008413	Aloha and thank you for sharing your review.

3299598	50007814	The staff is very friendly and accommodating.				
3299598	50007815	We stayed a total of 3 nights and we didn't want to leave at all.				
3299598	50007816	The hotel lends you a nice beach bag with towels and complimentary water and coffee.				
3299598	50007817	It was really enjoyable and don't forget the restaurant Mahina and Sun's in the hotel which is opened to all.				
3299598	50007818	We thought it was such a nice paradise in the middle of Waikiki.				
3299598	50007819	Big thanks to everyone at the Surfjack!				

3255173	50007820	D for Disgraceful..		80008427	Dear LBarrett-Scott Thank you for posting your review of your most recent stay with us here at the Macdonald Bath Spa Hotel.	
3255173	50007821	Dirty..		80008428	We do apologize for the experience that you received and are happy that you managed to address your concerns with our Manager and that he was able to provide you with adequate compensation.	
3255173	50007822	Disappointing ---SEP---		80008429	Should you wish to afford us another opportunity to be able to show you the standards that Macdonald Hotels are accustomed with, please contact our Duty Manager directly so that she is able to assist with your booking.	
3255173	50007823	We were looking forward to a few days exploring the delights of Bath and had been recommended The MacDoanlad Bath Spa Hotel by some friends.		80008430	Thank you and once again, our sincerest apologies.	
3255173	50007824	They had spoken so highly of it, so when we arrived I was wondering if there was another Bath Spa Hotel.		80008431	Yours sincerely The Leadership Team at the Macdonald Bath Spa Hotel	
3255173	50007825	There were initial signs that this would not be a great stay, when we rang to reserve a room.				
3255173	50007826	No information on the restaurant, spa packages just wanted to take our reservation (certainly not 5 star)				
3255173	50007827	"On arrival the same again ""you have reserved a classic room can I have your credit card for payment?"""				
3255173	50007828	No info on the hotel facilities, dining times.				
3255173	50007829	The only saving grace was the Head Concierge who took our bags and showed us up to the room.				
3255173	50007830	He asked us had we been to Bath before and then gave us some great tips on where to go and what to see.				
3255173	50007831	My expectations on our room were high as our friends and the website had portrayed delightfully presented rooms.				
3255173	50007832	"Were we blown away ""Not at all"" Shabby."				
3255173	50007833	Dirty..				
3255173	50007834	Mould growing around the sink and shower..				
3255173	50007835	Broken window catches..				
3255173	50007836	Fraying curtains.				
3255173	50007837	old moth eared menus...cup and bottle marks on the tables...broken hangers in the wardrobe....				
3255173	50007838	After a good walk round Bath (which is amazing) we thought we would relax in the Spa..				
3255173	50007839	This should be shut down for Health and Hygiene breeches!!				
3255173	50007840	Dirty.				
3255173	50007841	Cracked tiles.. probably last cleaned in the late sixties...				
3255173	50007842	No towels available..				
3255173	50007843	"Water dispenser empty.. """				
3255173	50007844	"Could we get some drinks by the pool? """				
3255173	50007845	""" No we do not serve drinks for Health and Safety reasons"" came the reply form the receptionist.."				
3255173	50007846	Perhaps she should look around the spa... Certainly not a relaxing experience...				
3255173	50007847	Our dinner in the restaurant was amazing.				
3255173	50007848	It was a shame that there were only a hand full of other guests in the dining room.. and the waiter recommended a wonderful flight of wines to accompany each dish, which worked really well.				
3255173	50007849	Breakfast on the other hand was a complete farce.				
3255173	50007850	Our cooked breakfast arrived before our coffee and toast.. dry pre-cooked ingredients.. the buffet..				
3255173	50007851	well I have seen better in a travel lodge!!				
3255173	50007852	Other guests were being seated and clearly walking out after not getting served.				
3255173	50007853	We were due to stay for two nights...				
3255173	50007854	But we could not endure any more.				
3255173	50007855	""""				
3255173	50007856	"you have booked two nights with us and we can not refund the second night "" said the receptionist on check-out...Can we speak to the Manager?"				
3255173	50007857	Who listened and agreed that our stay had not been to the standards they adhere to usually.				
3255173	50007858	He was more than happy to refund our one nights accommodation and cancel the second night without charge.				
3255173	50007859	We were very willing to pay for dinner and drinks in the bar...				
3255173	50007860	So we thought that would be the end to our horrific stay?				
3255173	50007861	After getting a receipt of our refund, I was disgusted to see a few days later the charge for the accommodation taken from our bank account...				
3255173	50007862	I rang the hotel to speak to the manager... on four occasions he was away from his desk.. messages taken.. finally on a fifth call I was put through to a PA..				
3255173	50007863	We talked and she would investigate...				
3255173	50007864	We are still waiting for the call back!!				
3255173	50007865	From the outside it looks like a 5 star hotel..				
3255173	50007866	It‚Äôs a shame the service and the product is not.				
3255173	50007867	I would advise to spend your money elsewhere.				

3249292	50007870	Nice enough but tired ---SEP---		80008442	Dear fioles Tahnk you for your feedback.	
3249292	50007871	Large room but very faded and tired looking, furniture badly damaged and the coffee and tea facilities are more like you would find in a roadside motel at the prices they charge coffee machines or plungers should be provided, mattress had a ridge down the middle!		80008443	I will ensure these points are taken on board and resolved.	
3249292				80008444	Thanks again Tim Buckton General Manager	

3181606	50007880	Next hotel ---SEP--- very modern hotel, the staff were very helpful and friendly, located right in the middle of the city, walking distance to restaurants and bars, we had a great view from our room.		80008455	Dear Faycorney, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Next Hotel.	
3181606	50007881	Would definitely book again.		80008456	I am happy to read you enjoyed your stay and the hotels location.	
3181606				80008457	Your feedback on the helpful and friendly staff will be pass onto our team.	
3181606				80008458	On the behalf of the team at Next Hotel we look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3181606				80008459	Kind Regards, Chad H	

3238089	50007890	Absolutely perfect! ---SEP---		80008460	Hello RayandAshley H, Thank you for the incredibly kind words about your time with us!	
3238089	50007891	This property is perfect for any type of visitor.		80008461	We believe that our property offerings provide something for everyone, and we are thrilled to hear you agree.	
3238089	50007892	Whether you are traveling to Disney with your family, coming to Orlando for a business visit, or looking for a romantic getaway this is by far the best place to stay.		80008462	We appreciate you sharing these compliments and we hope to welcome you back again soon!	
3238089	50007893	The ambiance is incredible.		80008463	Best regards, Ben Shank, Resort Manager	
3238089	50007894	Restaurants are romantic and delicious, but family friendly as well.				
3238089	50007895	The onsite water park and activities are such a great find at an upscale property.				
3238089	50007896	We will definitely be back and have recommended it to several friends already!!!				

3231087	50007900	Basic but extremely good value ---SEP---		80008474	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3231087	50007901	Honestly for 35 ¬£ prepaid, the room was above our expectations.		80008475	I am glad that your stay met with your expectations I hope that we can welcome you back to Ibis Leeds Centre in the near future	
3231087	50007902	Clean, nice bedding, tea/coffee facility, a bathroom block with a shower& toilets small but functional and modern.				
3231087	50007903	Nothing much to say.				
3231087	50007904	Staff nice and friendly, lobby and hotel itself not to be remembered but we didn't really hang out there.				
3231087	50007905	There is a large pay parking across the street, convenient but dangerous as you need to cross a three way lane without pedestrian way unless you walk a bit.				
3231087	50007906	Extremely good value for money.				

3313364	50007910	Marriot - Fallsview, nickle & dimed to death ---SEP---		80008486	Thank you for staying with us and sharing your compliment regarding the view from your guestroom during your visit.	
3313364	50007911	The room and view was very good.		80008487	The additional comments provided from your stay have been shared with our Team.	
3313364	50007912	The $30 parking and $10 wi-fi charge was not.		80008488	We hope that you will consider staying with us on your next trip to Niagara Falls.	
3313364	50007913	When I pay $300 a night for a hotel room, there are things I expect to be included.		80008489	Jeremy Brown Assistant General Manager	
3313364	50007914	If you're going to stiff me for parking, keep it reasonable, maybe $10?				
3313364	50007915	We found a spot about 1km away for $5.				
3313364	50007916	As for the wi-fi, there are 2 star motels that offer free wi-fi and the Marriot want's to charge me $10 after I dropped $300 on a room?!				
3313364	50007917	- what a joke.				
3313364	50007918	Unfortunately, our room was near the elevator - ding dong all night long.				
3313364	50007919	We went to Denny's for brunch the next day - the menu items were $5 to $10 more per meal than our local Denny's.				
3313364	50007920	If you're going to the falls, be prepared to be taken at every turn.				

3243131	50007930	Tired, scruffy but friendly staff ---SEP---		80008490	Dear Guest, I am so sorry for the issues you experienced during your stay.	
3243131	50007931	Strange location but cheap.		80008491	I would be happy to speak to you in regards to your stay in more detail if you wish and hopefully you will be happy to return to the hotel soon and have a more positive stay.	
3243131	50007932	Last minute business trip but a Travelodge would have been more modern.		80008492	Regards Piotr Matusiak Operations Manager	
3243131	50007933	My room had scuff marks on the wall two big dents in the bath stains on the sheets and thread bare carpet.				
3243131	50007934	However, staff are friendly and helpful.				

3212532	50007940	Opulent Spa ---SEP--- I took my niece for a girl's day out at the Corinthia spa.		80008503	Thank you for posting a glowing review of your experience in ESPA Life at Corinthia.	
3212532	50007941	We weren't staying.		80008504	It certainly sounds like you and your niece enjoyed a very special day out.	
3212532	50007942	From the welcome to the facilities to the treatments, we were in heaven!		80008505	We are very proud of our award-winning spa, the largest in London, and housing floors of relaxing luxury, with seventeen treatment rooms staffed by the most professional and highly trained therapists, a state-of-the-art gym with the very latest modern free weight and technical equipment, and a Thermal Floor with our silver-reflecting swimming pool, a vitality pool, an amphitheatre sauna with glass walls, and a steam room.	
3212532	50007943	The thermal room with steel swimming pool which reflected the ripples on the ceiling as you swam, the plunge pool and jacuzzi pods, the glass sided sauna and steam room was sophisticated, glamourous and beautiful in black and white.		80008506	As well as separate Mens and Ladies changing rooms that also have their own saunas and steam rooms, and best of all sleep pods for the ultimate in relaxation therapy.	
3212532	50007944	We lay on beautiful white sofas to relax around the pool in cocooning warmth.		80008507	We are very pleased that you also managed to enjoy a drink under the iconic Baccarat crystal chandelier in The Lobby Lounge, the perfect end to the perfect day.	
3212532	50007945	The modern chandelier in the first room with more white sofas was stunning!		80008508	The team at Corinthia London cannot wait to welcome you as a guest, when you may experience many of the other excellent facilities the hotel has to offer.	
3212532	50007946	And that was just one floor.		80008509	Kind Regards, Matthew Dixon, General Manager.	
3212532	50007947	Above us on the next floor was a gym and above that the chill and relax girls changing rooms and treatment rooms.				
3212532	50007948	And above that was the reception and lunch area.				
3212532	50007949	Beautiful open fires graced each floor with some having warm relaxation beds - which were blissful to lie on.				
3212532	50007950	We tried a manicure, pedicure, tailored facials, neck and back massage in private treatment suites.				
3212532	50007951	All were fabulous with information and advice carefully provided.				
3212532	50007952	The level of professionalism is sky high.				
3212532	50007953	I cost us a fortune but we loved it and will go back on a special occasion.				
3212532	50007954	Lunch in the spa restaurant was well-prepared and the menu diverse.				
3212532	50007955	Honestly the only fault I could find was a lack of facial moisturiser after I had the final shower of the day before I got dressed and left.				
3212532	50007956	Did I mention the cristal curtains in the changing rooms.				
3212532	50007957	I could go on...				
3212532	50007958	it was amazing!				
3212532	50007959	After that we had a quick drink in the central lobby bar.				
3212532	50007960	Amazing cocktails and beautiful flowers.				
3212532	50007961	We were so relaxed that we didn't wake up until midday the next day - sadly back at home...!				
3212532	50007962	Next time, we'll stay!				

3264931	50007970	Good accommodation for money ---SEP---		80008510	Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel.	
3264931	50007971	Family of 4 with 2 young kids (4 and 2 yo), this accommodation was perfect in terms of size - 2 bedrooms lakeside residence - facing the lake - make sure to be at the ground floor for a direct access to the promenade - kids loved the fire place and the boat ride to the city - be aware of the plane taking off (noise) as the hotel is very closed to the airport -		80008511	We take pride in offering a high level of accommodation, facilities and personal service and I am delighted to see that overall you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3264931				80008512	Thank you again for taking the time to share your experience, the team and I hope to once again welcome you back in a near future.	
3264931				80008513	Regards, Frederic Monnier Director of Operations	

3177897	50007980	Family trip ---SEP---		80008524	Thank you Cheri M!	
3177897	50007981	We stayed in a two bedroom unit and it was very nice and spacious.		80008525	We look forward to your next visit!	
3177897	50007982	The staff at the front desk were very nice, friendly, and helpful.				
3177897	50007983	It is just off Hwy 76, so it was kind of private, but close to everything.				
3177897	50007984	We will definitely stay here again.				

3267554	50007990	Clean, comfy and modern ---SEP---		80008536	Dear 938jeffreym, Thank you for your review and for staying with us recently.	
3267554	50007991	The staff was great, from the person at the door to the person at the front desk.		80008537	We're most thrilled to hear you found our hotel very clean and comfortable and you were greeted by our very personable team.	
3267554	50007992	They were helpful and nice.		80008538	We're happy you enjoyed the views from our rooms as well.	
3267554	50007993	The room had fantastic views and was modern.		80008539	We are thrilled to be your favorite Chicago hotel and we look forward to seeing you again soon.	
3267554	50007994	The room was very clean.		80008540	Thanks again, 938jeffreym.	
3267554	50007995	You can tell it was dusted, vacuumed well and roped off with nice linens.				
3267554	50007996	I might have found my goto hotel for Chicago trips.				

3315556	50008000	Convenient for a quick stop in Southern Highlands, great for golf ---SEP---		80008551	Dear JosyJoanne, Thank you for sharing your recent stay experience with the TripAdvisor Community!	
3315556	50008001	Accommodated well.		80008552	Your kind words were shared with the whole team with great appreciation.	
3315556	50008002	Restaurant was nice.		80008553	We have several board games kept with reception for children to play.	
3315556	50008003	Good for golfers, conference as well as couples.		80008554	In addition, there is a pool and tennis courts.	
3315556	50008004	Not sure there is much for young children and I had hoped for a marked garden walk .. looks nice on the website but not obvious walk.		80008555	We do have tennis rackets and balls kept with reception.	
3315556	50008005	Pool table available.		80008556	We truly look forward to welcoming you back to the Peppers Manor House in the near future and to have the opportunity to serve you.	
3315556				80008557	Kind Regards, Sukhjeev Kochar Front Office Manager	

3222322	50008010	Great conference venue ---SEP--- Just hosted a 150 person international conference here.		80008568	Dear ‚ÄúCupletBalsac‚Äù Thank you for taking the time to post your review.	
3222322	50008011	Excellent facilities, good staff and great service.		80008569	I am delighted that your conference went so well for you and that you benefited from the convenience of our location.	
3222322	50008012	Problems with booking system and flooding in some rooms (Dublin had terrible weather in late October 2011) caused a few issues ‚Äì and some of the staff can be a little bit 'cold' especially those not from Ireland - but all in all this is a great hotel to stay in Dublin.		80008570	I apologise that you found some team members to be below expectation and it is something we will certainly address.	
3222322	50008013	Big rooms, smart design and good conference facilities (for up to 100-120).		80008571	I hope that we get to welcome you back again, and if I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.	
3222322	50008014	It may appear to be outside the city centre		80008572	Kind regards, Gordon Callinan Hotel Manager on Duty email: gcallinan@thegibsonhotel.ie	
3222322	50008015	but it's only 5 stops from centre on efficient DART line - and has Aircoach stop 30metres from door.				
3222322	50008016	However, it will be another 20 years before the Docklands development is finished!				
3222322	50008017	(Also very close new Convention Centre)				

3292555	50008020	Will stay again ---SEP---		80008583	Dear 759siany, Thank you so much for taking your time to write us a review.	
3292555	50008021	The reception staff were fabulous on arrival, comfortable stay, classy decor, very tidy.		80008584	we are delighted to hear how much you loved your well-equipped, tidy and warm room.	
3292555	50008022	Warm and everything we needed was available.		80008585	We are sorry you were charged by the credit card you held your room with.	
3292555	50008023	The only thing that stopped me giving a 5/5 was the fact they deducted money off our credit card without informing me before hand, even though it clearly stated the CC number was taken just to hold the room and would not be charged unless we did not show.		80008586	If you book through a third party website, booking.com, expedia etc it states in the terms and conditions we can take payment up to 24 hours before arrival.	
3292555	50008024	Very disappointed in this as had planned to pay the full account by eftpos.		80008587	All bookings made direct with us whether it‚Äôs on our website or through the phone we don't usually take payment until you are with us - unless you will be arriving later in the evening.	
3292555				80008588	We do try and make contact with each guest on the day of arrival to get a time of arrival and if we cannot contact them ‚Äì we could pre-charge in this instance.	
3292555				80008589	We do however offer to refund a credit card if you wish to pay by other means once you have arrived.	
3292555				80008590	I hope this has cleared it up for you?	
3292555				80008591	we do look forward to welcoming you back again.	
3292555				80008592	Kind regards, The Team at Delorenzos Studio Apartments	

3233563	50008030	Excellent room ---SEP---		80008603	Hi, Thanks for the feedback!	
3233563	50008031	Room was excellent and so was the location.		80008604	We are constantly working on the most efficient ways for check in / check out and will continue to do so!	
3233563	50008032	A few bumps with checkin (if a corporate customer, ensure all details are confirmed prior to arrival).		80008605	Hope to see you again soon at Adina Melbourne Nathan Copsey Hotel Manager	
3233563	50008033	Make any allergies/intolerances very clear I when using room service and check on delivery.				
3233563	50008034	Otherwise, fantastic stay!				

3218676	50008040	Nestled in scenic spendour ---SEP--- Really nice hotel built against the slope with forest and mountains all around.		80008616	We are delighted that you enjoyed your most recent experience with us at The Rimrock and we hope we will be able to welcome you back in the future.	
3218676	50008041	It is out of town, but there is a shuttle, which hotel guests can use for free and you can walk down a track into town if you feel like a little exercise.		80008617	Remember to book direct to take advantage of our Best Rate Guarantee Program and best in class service!	
3218676	50008042	The view from the room was spectacular.		80008618	Yours In Hospitality, Rimrock Resort Hotel Management	
3218676	50008043	Staff are polite and helpful.				

3193151	50008050	We will be back!		80008629	Hi Thetribeoffive, Thanks for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.	
3193151	50008051	---SEP---		80008630	We're happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit and that you appreciated our hotel's convenient location near a variety of Chicago attractions.	
3193151	50008052	Beautiful hotel!		80008631	We'd love to welcome you back again soon.	
3193151	50008053	Perfect location for enjoying our weekend in Chicago.		80008632	Thanks again.	
3193151	50008054	So much in walking distance.				
3193151	50008055	Great staff!				
3193151	50008056	Enjoyed Land and Sea - try the avocado goat cheese toast!				
3193151	50008057	Thank you Shane Blidy for encouraging us to share our great experience!				

3216137	50008060	Friends maternity ---SEP---		80008643	Thank you for your five star review, it is great to see you had a great stay with your friends and enjoyed your Spa treatments.	
3216137	50008061	We came on the 2nd march me and 2 friends to start off my friends maternity.		80008644	We look forward to welcoming you back at the end of the month.	
3216137	50008062	The massage was unbelievable and the entire weekend was perfect.		80008645	Best regards Andy	
3216137	50008063	Booked in again for end of March for two nights for mother‚Äôs day with my mum.				

3268991	50008070	Handy motel in a convenient location ---SEP---		80008656	Thank you for your kind review, I appreciate it.	
3268991	50008071	This is an excellent motel , the owner was efficient and welcoming , the price was good and the rooms large with all we needed included, I have no hesitation recommending it.		80008657	I am happy that you enjoyed your stay and and your room was comfortable .	
3268991	50008072	It was spotlessly clean with a good shower with lots of hot water		80008658	Please come again!	
3268991				80008659	Thank you: Sue Wayside Motel	

3252596	50008080	Lunch with the family ---SEP--- Started off with a beer In the snug and then moved into the little private dining room, very intimate and personal service.		80008660	Dear Leigh R, Thank you for reviewing your lunch at the Maids Head.	
3252596	50008081	Good food and wine, nice setting, then across the road to the lawyer (pub opposite) to have a night cap.		80008661	I will pass on your praise to the team.	
3252596	50008082	Overall a very nice day.		80008662	We have just launched a new menu so I hope you will be back to try something different!	
3252596				80008663	Kind regards Andrew S Operations manager	

3302484	50008090	Grand in location NOT in hotel ---SEP--- Hotel booked almost 3 months ago for New Year.		80008674	Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write your review.	
3302484	50008091	Family of 4 travelled who are used to staying in 4* plus hotels across the UK and Europe.		80008675	It is disappointing to see that you have not enjoyed your stay with us.	
3302484	50008092	Confirmed via email from staff member we would receive interconnecting rooms in the new refurbished section of the hotel.		80008676	We are sorry you felt you did not receive a satisfactory level of response from our management team in response to your concerns.	
3302484	50008093	To our disappointment we were given rooms 800 and 801 which not only smelt of smoke but also showed extensive evidence of wear and tear.		80008677	The hotel has over 200 bedrooms, all of which are continually refurbished on rotation.	
3302484	50008094	Drawers were broken, wardrobes broken and skirting/architraves showed signs of chipping and damage.		80008678	The rooms you were allocated were unfortunately the last of our older style rooms which are this actually this week being fully refurbished to bring the whole hotel up to the same standards.	
3302484	50008095	This WAS NOT what we had booked or expected.		80008679	We are now a completely non smoking property and all of the fixtures and fitting on the former smoking floor have been fully replaced.	
3302484	50008096	On complaining we were told, by a junior member of staff (yet to be approached by the manager) , that the type of interconnecting room we had booked for New Year was unavailable.		80008680	The hotel dates back to 1835 and in the original building, piping can sometimes make some noise in colder weather.	
3302484	50008097	We decided to give the hotel benefit of the doubt and accepted a room with 2 double beds.		80008681	New Years eve is such a very busy night at the hotel and it isn't always possible to offer our guests alternative rooms when we are fully occupied.	
3302484	50008098	In retrospect this room was totally inappropriate for our needs.		80008682	The Matt Ryan bar is a much loved local bar and usually a hive of activity at the weekends with guests and regulars enjoying the scene.	
3302484	50008099	To add insult to injury the heating system will keep you awake (459) from 05.45 with extensive and unbearable noises.		80008683	Wifi is offered to all our guests complimentary and only charged nominally after a certain time period has expired.	
3302484	50008100	Whilst I appreciate the hotel dates to mid 1800's this is meant to be the new 'refurbished' section of the hotel.		80008684	Your experience concerns us as we are very proud of our commitment to customer service and our recent reviews and awards are testimony to this.	
3302484	50008101	I have stayed in other 'character' hotels ie Castle Leslie/Coombe Abbey with no such problems.		80008685	If you wish to discuss your stay with us in further detail, we would be very happy to call or meet with you.	
3302484	50008102	At no point in our stay were we approached by management to discuss our issues.		80008686	Please contact our management office directly.	
3302484	50008103	Front facing staff were very nice but lacked any authority to rectify the situation.				
3302484	50008104	In essence and in our honest opinion this hotel lacks the relevant extra touches to merit its 4 stars.				
3302484	50008105	( not even free wifi in communal areas - Gibneys Pub even had free wifi )				
3302484	50008106	The hotel itself including the bar area felt very 'soulless'.				
3302484	50008107	Due to lack of meeting our needs combined with the early morning heating 'call' we checked out circa 07.30 and made alternative arrangements for New Year so as not to let our boys down.				
3302484	50008108	Would not return and would not recommend if looking for a 'true' 4 star plus experience.				

3280638	50008110	Luxury stay and comfort ---SEP---		80008697	Good Afternoon Susha S, Thank you for staying with us at the Radisson Blu Glasgow and leaving such a glowing review.	
3280638	50008111	Radisson blu is at the best location in Glasgow.		80008698	I'm so glad to see that the staff looked after you so well and that you had a comfortable and relaxed evening in your room.	
3280638	50008112	It is near to the central station and all the historical monuments.i would highly recommend it.		80008699	I look forward to welcoming you back to stay at the hotel again in the near future.	
3280638	50008113	Staff is awesome as well as the service.it has gym ,swimming and other leisure which i enjoyed.		80008700	Many thanks, Lee - Guest Service manager	

3176084	50008120	Amazing customer service ---SEP---		80008711	Dear Guest, There is no better and more appreciated compliment than to learn our guests are impressed and happy with the service we strive to deliver every day.	
3176084	50008121	The facility is beautiful with an amazing view of the city.		80008712	Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay and for your kind appraisal of Agnes.	
3176084	50008122	There are many restaurants, venues, and points of interest within walking distance.		80008713	I am delighted to share your comments with our team and we will look forward to welcoming your return in the near future.	
3176084	50008123	I was most impressed by the customer service received while staying at the hotel.		80008714	Sincerely, Elizabeth Vita-Finzi Hotel Manager	
3176084	50008124	Every employee greeted us with a warm smile.				
3176084	50008125	Agnes from the front desk was very gracious in that she made an extra effort to insure that we enjoyed our stay.				

3297639	50008130	Brilliant hotel in the bright lights of Brighton ---SEP--- Stayed here for four nights over the Christmas and New Year with a friend.		80008725	Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback and comments on TripAdvisor following your recent visit.	
3297639	50008131	Personally, we both found Queens Hotel to be the perfect location to explore Brighton.		80008726	I was sorry to see that you experienced a problem with accessing the internet on the second last night of your visit.	
3297639	50008132	One is in the heart of the action with the promenade, beach and Brighton's famous amusement pier right outside your door so we got to ring in the New Year in style on the beach.		80008727	We upgraded our internet provider and service about 4 months ago , and although your experience was indeed inconvenient , I am pleased to report that it was an exception to the normal internet service at our hotel.	
3297639	50008133	Can't get much better than that.		80008728	thank you also for your very helpful feedback regarding our breakfast service , and we shall indeed bear your observations in mind when we are next reviewing the morning buffet service.	
3297639	50008134	You are also near all the shops, restaurants, bars and clubs and local attractions.		80008729	Certainly , it is really great to see that you would really like to return , and of course also it is so nice to see that you found our staff to have been helpful and friendly.	
3297639	50008135	It is only a 10 minute walk to the train station so you don't even have to worry about taxis.				
3297639	50008136	The hotel itself is undoubtedly old and a little bit tired in areas but we found this added to the character of the place.				
3297639	50008137	Granted, a couple of chairs in the reception area could do with an upgrade but the bedrooms were clean and comfortable with a large bed, plasma tv and ample storage space.				
3297639	50008138	There was constant hot water even if the water pressure in the shower was a little weak.				
3297639	50008139	The internet broke down on our second-last day.				
3297639	50008140	The lady at the reception did give us a cable to allow us access the broadband but this broke down the day after.				
3297639	50008141	I don't know if this is a regular occurrence but it wasn't something that overly bothered us.				
3297639	50008142	We didn't use the spa so can't comment on it.				
3297639	50008143	Likewise, we didn't eat in the bar although I'm not sure if the bar was serving food as it tended to be quiet in the evenings.				
3297639	50008144	Breakfast was very good.				
3297639	50008145	They have a mixture of hot and cold food.				
3297639	50008146	Some yoghurt would have been nice but again, minor complaint.				
3297639	50008147	Our biggest complaint (if we were to be picky) would be the arrangements for breakfast.				
3297639	50008148	The breakfast room is undoubtedly too small and we had to queue for seats almost every morning.				
3297639	50008149	Perhaps an extension is in order.				
3297639	50008150	Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this hotel.				
3297639	50008151	The staff were helpful and knowledgeable and we would definitely love to return.				
3297639	50008152	Keep up the great work :)				

3219904	50008160	lovely drives around and about ---SEP--- Large spacious room with very comfortable beds, the restaurant food was very nice, though I do object to paying an extra $9 for veggies.		80008730	Good afternoon, Thank you kindly for providing us with your honest feedback from your recent stay with us at Atura Albury.	
3219904	50008161	Staff were very friendly and helpful.		80008731	We appreciate you taking the time to let us know your thoughts!	
3219904	50008162	Car parking was insecure and inconvenient if you have luggage.		80008732	You can be assured that I have passed your comments on to the relevant staff.	
3219904	50008163	Very well located at the edge of town, within walking distance to shops and restaurants.		80008733	Thanks again	
3219904	50008164	Would definitely stay here again.		80008734	and we look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel next time you are in Albury!	
3219904				80008735	Warmest regards, Jodi Brown	

3249444	50008170	Great hotel ---SEP---		80008746	Dear Fiferose, Thank you for your kind review.	
3249444	50008171	Another great hotel we loved the old fanshioned large rooms.		80008747	It's wonderful to hear that you found both your stay at our hotel and your meal at The old spaghetti factory Restaurant enjoyable.	
3249444	50008172	It is just off the Main Street near all the restaurants and bars.		80008748	Best Regards, Sarah Huang	
3249444	50008173	Comfy warm cosy and quiet in lovely Banff.				
3249444	50008174	The old spaghetti factory is a good cheap eat just one block away.				

3324402	50008180	More of a business or function venue ---SEP---		80008759	Louise A, Thank you for your review.	
3324402	50008181	We found the hotel catered for large business groups and functions.		80008760	Here at The Alexander we try and cater to everyone that stays with us.	
3324402	50008182	Our room overlooked the car park.		80008761	I do apologize you felt we did not cater to you needs.	
3324402	50008183	The entrance and staff are very welcoming.		80008762	I am glad to hear that our staff was welcoming.	
3324402	50008184	The location is not convenient to downtown needing to drive to most activities.		80008763	I do hope you can give us another chance on your next visit.	
3324402				80008764	Tim Ribich Guest Services manager	

3313415	50008190	Highest praise ---SEP---		80008775	Dear Les B, Thank you very much for your review.	
3313415	50008191	A lovely hotel in a perfect setting with excellent service from the friendliest staff.		80008776	I will pass on your compliments to my dad, Neil, to my mom, Katy (who runs the kitchen) and the rest of our team!	
3313415	50008192	Neil runs a terrific team who blend excellent service with easy light hearted conversation.		80008777	We're really lucky that we have such a great team working with us.	
3313415	50008193	The food is outstanding and the ambience of the hotel adds to the enjoyment		80008778	Thanks once again, Ali	

3194288	50008200	Top Class Hotel ---SEP---		80008789	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your feedback.	
3194288	50008201	This was my second trip to the Westport Plaza with my wife.		80008790	We are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay so much and for your kind words regarding our rooms, bar and restaurant and Spa Sula.	
3194288	50008202	Five years ago being the first, and I remember being blown away by the place.		80008791	I appreciate also you constructive feedback regarding some areas for improvement which have been duly noted.	
3194288	50008203	So arriving I had expectations, big expectations.		80008792	The main thing is that you greatly enjoyed your stay and recommend it to others and for this we thank you and we hope to welcome you back soon.	
3194288	50008204	The Plaza lived up to it in every way.		80008793	Yours sincerely John Clesham Manager	
3194288	50008205	The room was beautiful, the deal we got included two nights B&B and an evening meal in the beautiful Merlot Restaurant, but our room was a suite looking out onto the roof garden.				
3194288	50008206	It was spacious, comfortable and had one free movie per day included.				
3194288	50008207	The room also had a kitchenette and mini bar.				
3194288	50008208	The only negative being the height of the shower head, I'm only 6ft and I had to crouch to get under it.				
3194288	50008209	A minor design flaw but the Jacuzzi bath certainly made up for it.				
3194288	50008210	We had a lunch in the bar which was tasty but nothing special, some of the servers were in training but you wouldn't know it.				
3194288	50008211	We also ate in the Restaurant Merlot as part of the package and again I enjoyed every minute of it.				
3194288	50008212	The food was very tasty and piping hot.				
3194288	50008213	Breakfast was plentiful and well cooked, but I feel the quality of the ingredients could be improved upon to make it just that bit better, to tip it over the edge so to speak.				
3194288	50008214	We also made use of the thermal suites and the Rasul Chamber.				
3194288	50008215	To be honest the Chamber was okay, but I wouldn't do it again, the suites are well kept and very enjoyable, including the outdoor rock pool.				
3194288	50008216	I would have liked to have the run of the spa explained a bit better to me but its not by any means a deal breaker.				
3194288	50008217	All in all it was again a very enjoyable stay in a beautiful part of the country.				
3194288	50008218	The hotel is located just a few minutes from everything in Westport including Westport House.				
3194288	50008219	I will say this though, as much as I enjoyed the stay the staff although not unfriendly weren't overly friendly.				
3194288	50008220	It really felt like they were just doing their job and no more, which is fine but just a little cold.				
3194288	50008221	But two members that stood out for their friendliness and welcoming were the young girl, with black hair on reception Monday 23.03.15 and the gentleman who I presumed was the restaurant manager.				
3194288	50008222	Neither could have been more friendly and welcoming if they tried.				
3194288	50008223	Also the WIFi is excellent.				
3194288	50008224	I know I picked some negatives in this review, but as I said overall I really enjoyed my stay again, any criticisms are meant purely to be constructive				
3194288	50008225	and I certainly wouldn't put anyone off staying in this lovely hotel.

3265809	50008251	This is my new favourite hotel in Adelaide!

3258049	50008282	The airport is located five minutes away.		80008852	Kind Regards Helen Devlin General Manager	
3258049	50008283	Premier Inns is a good brand and I have stayed in a number of different ones in Britain and Ireland.				
3258049	50008284	The room was large with extremely comfortable beds.				
3258049	50008285	We had a meal there which was average but we knew that in advance and didn't feel like going out.				
3258049	50008286	Service was good and friendly.				
3258049	50008287	There was some low level noise from the nearby nightclub but not enough to disturb our sleep.				
3258049	50008288	All in all a very good experience.				

3271695	50008290	Pleasant Stay ---SEP--- Staff is friendly and always ready to help.		80008863	Dear Franciney C, Thank you for sharing your feedback following your pleasant stay at Park Hyatt Melbourne.

3186274	50008300	Another fabulous stay ---SEP---		80008878	Dear Guest, We are delighted to see that you had such an enjoyable stay with us recently.	
3186274	50008301	The plaza never fails to deliver.		80008879	Thank you for your lovely review and recommendation.	
3186274	50008302	We came for a great value mid week deal and it was top notch, as per usual.		80008880	We hope to welcome you back again for more happy stays in the future Wishing you a very happy Christmas and best wishes for 2020, On behalf of all at the Plaza, John Clesham Manager	
3186274	50008303	We stayed in room 500 which is bigger than my first apartment that I lived in.				
3186274	50008304	We had lovely treats on the table & wine.				
3186274	50008305	We had access to the thermal spa-				
3186274	50008306	so relaxing.				
3186274	50008307	The breakfast was lovely.				
3186274	50008308	The staff were so pleasant and helpful.				
3186274	50008309	I just love our little breaks away to the Westport Plaza & I highly recommend a night away here.				
3186274	50008310	Really perfect.				
3186274	50008311	Well done all!!				

3265213	50008320	Best catering to pets and large, comfortable room ---SEP---		80008891	Thanks you so much for taking the time share your great feedback and experience at the Comfort Suites Saskatoon.	
3265213	50008321	We stayed for one night on August 20 while driving from Hinton, AB home to Winnipeg, MB.		80008892	It great to have our efforts acknowledged.	
3265213	50008322	As our family is now in Hinton and because we were so impressed with this hotel‚Äôs accommodations for us and our dog, this hotel will always be our number one choice for our rest stop on this specific road trip.		80008893	We certainly like to treat our guests pets like the important family members that they are to you.	
3265213	50008323	Smooth check in occurred and then we were so surprised by the welcome kit our dog received.		80008894	I'm delighted that you highly recommend our hotel and that we will be your #1 stop when you pass through Saskatoon.	
3265213	50008324	So sweet and thoughtful.		80008895	Much appreciated!!	
3265213	50008325	Some hotels charge $100 for dogs to stay and I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt receive a welcome kit.				
3265213	50008326	This hotel charges a very reasonable $25/night per dog and throws in a kit including a map of local area dog parks, a toy, a couple waste bags and treats!				
3265213	50008327	Very thoughtful; thank you.				
3265213	50008328	The other aspect we loved with this pet friendly hotel is that all families with pets are to stay on the first floor of the hotel.				
3265213	50008329	This made it a lot easier when checking in and when needing to go outside so our dog could pee and poo.				
3265213	50008330	Plus, directly outside the nearest exit of the pet friendly ‚Äúwing‚Äù is a nice open green space with a waste station if owners forget waste bags.				
3265213	50008331	The room was large and very comfortable, clean and contemporary.				
3265213	50008332	We really enjoyed our stay and sleep.				
3265213	50008333	The pool area is a nice bonus.				
3265213	50008334	Highly recommend this hotel if needing a pet friendly stay in Saskatoon.				

3275831	50008340	Nothing like it advertises ---SEP---		80008906	Aloha and thank you for your review.	
3275831	50008341	Thought this would be a great place after seeing pictures of how great is was.		80008907	I apologize that your stay with us was less than ideal, and I have shared your concerns with my management team.	
3275831	50008342	Very disappointed.		80008908	With seven restaurants and two take-away spots, Turtle Bay Resort offers numerous dining options.	
3275831	50008343	Car park always full with people just going to the beach leaving hotel customers to park a long way from the hotel.		80008909	I am sorry that your experience fell short and that you were unable to enjoy our locally sourced, fresh island flavors.	
3275831	50008344	All restaurants were always full morning and night.		80008910	I understand your frustration about parking.	
3275831	50008345	Had to wait ages for breakfast.		80008911	As a beachside resort, we adhere to state laws requiring beach access and parking.	
3275831	50008346	Nothing special.		80008912	Our unique location and popular beach are a draw to locals and visitors.	
3275831				80008913	Fortunately, due to the size of our resort, we can accommodate everyone although the walk to the hotel may be a few more minutes some days.	
3275831				80008914	As the only destination resort on the North Shore, Turtle Bay Resort is a popular launching pad to explore legendary surfing spots, uncrowded beaches, beautiful hiking trails, cute local boutiques and amazing mom-and-pop eateries.	
3275831				80008915	The resort itself features 15 miles of oceanfront and mountain hiking and biking trails, on-site helipad offering helicopter tours around the island, horseback rides from the resort‚Äôs own Stables, 36 holes of championship golf and on-site surf school instruction.	
3275831				80008916	I hope you discovered the laid-back charm of Oahu‚Äôs North Shore and that you returned home relaxed and recharged.	
3275831				80008917	With warmest aloha, Danna Holck, vice president & general manager	

3249539	50008350	A decent hotel but there are better options in Moncton ---SEP---		80008928	Thank you for your review.	
3249539	50008351	We've stayed at this property on many occasions.		80008929	We appreciate your feedback.	
3249539	50008352	We've had both positive and negative experiences.		80008930	It is important to us to understand the areas we can improve upon.	
3249539	50008353	I will start with the positive.		80008931	We have given your review to our housekeeping department and will use it as a training tool moving forward.	
3249539	50008354	1.		80008932	Again, thank you for providing us with feedback.	
3249539	50008355	The staff is friendly 2.		80008933	We sincerely appreciate it	
3249539	50008356	Free breakfast 3.				
3249539	50008357	Affordable 4.				
3249539	50008358	Convenient location close to many amenities and attractions 5.				
3249539	50008359	Lots of parking Some negative points we've encountered were 1.				
3249539	50008360	Dirty linen (Once had towels with blood on them) 2.				
3249539	50008361	No shampoo and body wash in the shower dispensers 3.				
3249539	50008362	Carpets were not clean 4.				
3249539	50008363	Noisy location due to being right next to the highway 5.				
3249539	50008364	Some rooms are bright at night time, making it hard to sleep.				
3249539	50008365	In closing, this hotel is good if other options are not available.				
3249539	50008366	I would highly recommend at least 5-6 other properties in Moncton before checking in here.				

3280454	50008370	Great Views ---SEP--- Perfect position, on the beach.		80008944	Dear Bronwyn M I was pleased to read you were satisfied with the service you received.	
3280454	50008371	Swimming Pool very luke warm !!!		80008945	Thank you for your support and the time you have taken to review your stay.	
3280454	50008372	Meals a little expensive.		80008946	Regards, Adam Haywood General Manager	
3280454	50008373	Service was fantastic.				
3280454	50008374	Staff very helpful & friendly.				
3280454	50008375	Great to hire bike & ride along promenade.				
3280454	50008376	Close to shops.				

3200765	50008380	Excellent stay at Dromoland ---SEP---		80008957	Dear 284danelles Thank you for choosing to stay with us at Dromoland Castle during your recent vacation in Ireland.	
3200765	50008381	This castle is awesome!		80008958	We were so pleased to welcome you to visit and delighted that you enjoyed your stay.	
3200765	50008382	The rooms were luxurious, yet homey.		80008959	I hope that we have the privilege of welcoming you back to visit us if traveling to Ireland in the future.	
3200765	50008383	The grounds are beautiful to walk.		80008960	Sincerely Mark Nolan - General Manager	
3200765	50008384	The gardens are lovely.				
3200765	50008385	During our stay we enjoyed Falconry, Archery and Horseback riding.				
3200765	50008386	The instructors were personable and attentive.				
3200765	50008387	Daniel, Darrin and Sarah at the stables, thank you!!				
3200765	50008388	And the driver who escorted us to the stable and dinner was a treasure!				
3200765	50008389	Gerard entertained us with stories and local information.				
3200765	50008390	We thoroughly enjoyed everything!!				

3178745	50008400	Back to usual standard ---SEP--- I arrived to be told I had been upgraded to an executive room which was at the front of the building and meant I could open 4 small windows which helped as the room was warm and the fan provided didn't cool the room well.		80008971	Many thanks for taking the time to post your review and I am pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3178745	50008401	Bed is comfortable, the bathroom could do with an update and the water pressure could have been better.		80008972	We will of course discuss your very constructive remarks with the team here but I will pass on your very kind comments to all of the team here We all look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3178745	50008402	The breakfast was as lovely as always, I liked the fact they have started to have fresh milk on tables.		80008973	Keith Walford General Manager	
3178745	50008403	There is bread but wonder if offering rolls might be something to think about.				
3178745	50008404	The staff were all really friendly and helpful.				

3214110	50008410	Location excellent, extremely helpful staff ---SEP---		80008984	Hello wilbur12, thanks so much for your review.	
3214110	50008411	From when we checked in to time of departure the Manageress was extremely friendly and obliging.		80008985	We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay & we are so grateful for your recommendations.	
3214110	50008412	The room was large and very well appointed and spotlessly clean.		80008986	We hope to see you again soon!	
3214110	50008413	It was a short walk to town and very quiet.		80008987	Kind regards, Emma	
3214110	50008414	You need to take any refreshments you want because there are no shops nearby.				
3214110	50008415	I would thoroughly recommend this property to anyone staying in Margaret River.				

3325857	50008420	Well below expectations ---SEP---		80008998	Dear shady620, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.	
3325857	50008421	Booked Novotel Rotorua for a winter escape in August.		80008999	While I wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve.	
3325857	50008422	We booked on Thursday night.		80009000	We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short.	
3325857	50008423	Drove to the hotel.		80009001	If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.	
3325857	50008424	We had asked for a late checkout and a room facing the lake.		80009002	Please get in touch with me if you would like to discuss this further.	
3325857	50008425	"Upon arrival we were reminder that we are ""Classic Members"" for the Le Club awards so that would be no upgrade."		80009003	I look forward to hear from you.	
3325857	50008426	Once inside the room,we noticed the pillows were sruffy and large spots on the carpet.				
3325857	50008427	These spots were fresh.				
3325857	50008428	We called the guy who checked us in.				
3325857	50008429	We told him that we would like to check out.				
3325857	50008430	He invited us to talk to the duty manager.				
3325857	50008431	The duty manager was unapologetic and had no interest in empathising.				
3325857	50008432	She took us to another room on level 3.				
3325857	50008433	This room wasn't lake facing but had better pillows.				
3325857	50008434	In front of the door there was a large stain on the carpet.				
3325857	50008435	We checked in, went for a quick walk to the lake.				
3325857	50008436	Decided that the hotel experience had spoilt our holiday.				
3325857	50008437	We asked to check out due to the poor state of the rooms.				
3325857	50008438	The same duty manager was unapologetic.				
3325857	50008439	However, she wasn't willing to confirm that there would be no charges.				
3325857	50008440	After a few strong words, she agreed to confirm via email.				
3325857	50008441	We checked out and moved into Rydges Rotorua.				
3325857	50008442	The experience was much better and for once the hotel cared about their guests.				
3325857	50008443	DO NOT go to Novotel.				
3325857	50008444	Horrible experience.				

3321595	50008450	Simply Amazing!!		80009014	Lawrence, thank you for your great review, I am delighted that you had a wonderful visit to Tofino and to the Lodge.	
3321595	50008451	---SEP---		80009015	Both our Chef Ian and Captain Josh are superstars!

3321595	50008453	Everyone is so kind and readily available to help in any way they can.		80009017	We will look forward to welcoming you back as return guests.	
3321595	50008454	Our ocean view balcony room was so great it was hard to leave, but we did.		80009018	Tim	
3321595	50008455	We walked the beach, relaxed on the balcony, enjoyed the hot tub and enjoyed fantastic dinners and continental breakfasts at the Lodge.				
3321595	50008456	Homemade EVERYTHING!!				
3321595	50008457	YUM!!				
3321595	50008458	Captain Josh took us for an ocean adventure....even though the day was a little stormy..we learned history, saw many eagles, experienced rough waters and learned that sometimes waves look like whales.				
3321595	50008459	We will definitely visit again...and will bring the whole family!!				
3321595	50008460	Thank you for a great 4 days!!

3213542	50008473	Only issue was parking they had an arrangement with a car park				
3213542	50008474	but we did not find it easy to locate and drove around a few times.				
3213542	50008475	\In the end we ended up parking else where at 14 pound for the night.				
3213542	50008476	However we would stay again.

3262060	50008493	Very pleasant stop prior to walking down to Snowdrop Valley Local places like this deserve support so...if in the area please give it a go				

3267114	50008500	Great Bar, Great Staff, Small Room, Great Time ---SEP---		80009068	Dear Jason W, Thank you for sharing your review!	
3267114	50008501	Booked this place after spending a few days at a business conference.		80009069	I'm glad you chose Hive with our great and central location for your extended getaway!	
3267114	50008502	It was the perfect place for my wife and I to extend our trip and see the sights in Washington DC.		80009070	I'm happy you both got the chance to visit the bar and enjoy the fireplace.	
3267114	50008503	Within easy, and safe walking distance from the Lincoln Memorial, and across the street from George Washington University.		80009071	We are glad to offer our luggage storage before check-in and after check-out and I'm delighted that it allowed you to see more of the city!	
3267114	50008504	This was our first experience with a Micro Hotel, and the rooms were as advertised...small.		80009072	We can't wait to have you with us next time you're traveling to DC!	
3267114	50008505	They have a great bar next to the lobby, with a fireplace, and plenty of window seating.		80009073	Thanks, Bryna	
3267114	50008506	There is also a rooftop bar with views of the Lincoln Memorial.				
3267114	50008507	The Staff was extremely friendly (to a person) and held our bags before first check-in, and after check-out while we did some last minute sight seeing.				
3267114	50008508	The location has easy access to two Metro stations (10 minute walk).				
3267114	50008509	"The room service and bar food menus are supplied by the quick turn pizza restaurant (called ""&pizza"") which can be accessed from the lobby."				
3267114	50008510	We stayed in and had pizza and drinks at the bar both nights of our stay.				
3267114	50008511	I would go back to Hotel Hive anytime I was travelling to DC.				

3252894	50008520	Pleasant Surprise ---SEP---		80009084	Thanks for your top review Mick!	
3252894	50008521	This is my new favourite place to stay in the Central West.		80009085	The photos look terrific - thank you for sharing with the TA community.	
3252894	50008522	Freshly renovated rooms are modern and trendy and very well appointed for business.		80009086	Its great to know that your room suited you perfectly while you were in Dubbo on business.	
3252894	50008523	Friendly, welcoming and informative staff with personalised recommendations for dining options.		80009087	We've put a lot of thought into how the rooms will be used so I'm glad it ticked all the boxes.	
3252894	50008524	Highly recommended.		80009088	We'd love to have you stay with us again!	
3252894				80009089	New fav Central West accommodation is a pretty big compliment :-)	
3252894				80009090	Best wishes, Manda & Rob	

3303068	50008530	Well run motel ---SEP---		80009101	Thankyou very much for your comments, we appreciate your time to write a review and we thank you for choosing to stay with us, Hope you enjoyed your time in Wanganui and glad to hear you were happy with your accommodation.	
3303068	50008531	The young folks running this place are doing a great job.		80009102	Its nice to hear we are on the right track.	
3303068	50008532	The rooms are large and the motel is situated in a quiet location.		80009103	Kind Regards Mel, Mike and Tom	
3303068	50008533	A most enjoyable stay.				

3219431	50008540	Top location, great views of marina ---SEP---		80009114	WOW, sounds like we ticked all the boxes!	
3219431	50008541	We were at Hervey Bay for the start of the Ocean Festival.		80009115	We are glad you had a fabulous time, and look forward to hosting you again soon.	
3219431	50008542	The Mantra is right in the middle of the boat harbour/marina right next to the whale boat pontoons, boutiques and shops.				
3219431	50008543	The resort is a little dated but the clean, reasonably presented rooms are of a good size with front balconies overlooking the marina.				
3219431	50008544	The pool also overlooks the marina and is a gorgeous deep blue lit colour at night.				
3219431	50008545	Cafe Balaena is right next door, great for beautiful meals and The Dock is also just there, serving awesome tapas with a bustling bar.				

3258214	50008550	The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and Lloyd ---SEP---		80009126	Dear gmcCalifornia, thank you for your review.	
3258214	50008551	My wife and I spent 6 nights at the Hilton Queenstown, New Zealand and really left with mixed feelings about the stay.		80009127	Firstly I want to thank you for your kind word about Lloyd.	
3258214	50008552	Last year I had over 150 nights in hotels and have never left a hotel as perplexed as I was when leaving this property.		80009128	I will make sure that he gets recognised for his customer service.	
3258214	50008553	LLOYD:		80009129	Secondly the pricing in all our hotel facilities are constantly reviewed and reflect the market and the competition in the same category.	
3258214	50008554	The Cru Wine Bar has a bartender named Lloyd.		80009130	Your feedback is highly appreciated and I have shared it with the management team to take into consideration.	
3258214	50008555	He is awesome!		80009131	Please accept my sincere apologise for the poor standard of housekeeping.	
3258214	50008556	Rare to find such a professional poised young man.		80009132	Please rest assured this is not the standard we aim to offer.	
3258214	50008557	A true asset to this hotel.		80009133	I have shared your feedback with the Executive Housekeeper to action accordingly.	
3258214	50008558	THE GOOD: This property is a beautiful property for sure.		80009134	At booking stage all New Zealand Hilton Hotels advise our guest about the credit card supplement charge.	
3258214	50008559	Located right on the lake with generous walking paths it is truly an unique property with a wonderful feeling.		80009135	I have also shared your feedback about the supplement charge for credit cards on regional level to review.	
3258214	50008560	The rooms are nicely appointed and are very very comfortable even with fireplaces.		80009136	I hope we have another opportunity to welcome you back.	
3258214	50008561	The breakfast is OUTSTANDING and we really looked forward to having breakfast every morning which is funny because we are not big breakfast people.		80009137	Kind regards Mario	
3258214	50008562	THE BAD: The property is located about 30 minutes from town which can be a bit of an issue if you want to freely go to town.				
3258214	50008563	A shuttle runs ever half hour or so which is OK.				
3258214	50008564	The bad part about this is that the Hilton Queenstown recognizes they have you trapped away from town and make every effort to suck every dollar out of you at every turn.				
3258214	50008565	A glass of average wine $16.00, A personal pizza $28.00, a beer $10.00, Chinese food for two with no drinks $60.00, bottled water $6.50, etc. etc. etc.				
3258214	50008566	I expect to pay a little more in hotels but these folks take to another level.				
3258214	50008567	Although the rooms are really nice housekeeping doe the absolute minimum required with zero extra effort.				
3258214	50008568	When we arrived there was a roll-away bed in the room and after calling three times to have it removed I finally went to the front desk to personally ask.				
3258214	50008569	There were no chairs on the balcony which also required 4 requests to get them so we could enjoy the view.				
3258214	50008570	Not once in a week were the dirty windows or glass balcony walls cleaned.				
3258214	50008571	We decided to see if our room was being vacuumed and placed small pieces of paper on the floor in obvious locations where they remained for three days.				
3258214	50008572	THE UGLY: After a solid week of being sucked dry of every dollar possible this hotel charges 1.5% if you use a credit card to settle your bill - UNREAL!!!				
3258214	50008573	I doubt many people pay in cash to stay a week at a hotel.				
3258214	50008574	I would imagine they could easily put 1.5% in the rate and you would never feel it.				
3258214	50008575	This really rubbed me the wrong way....				
3258214	50008576	Overall, I would likely not stay here again and opt for another hotel because of the blatant quest for revenue that this hotel strives for.				

3271052	50008580	not up to standard ---SEP---		80009148	Our location slap bang in the centre of Cardiff unfortunately does have its downsides.	
3271052	50008581	Let's start with arrival.		80009149	Lively bustle can make access to the hotel and car park tricky.	
3271052	50008582	There is nowhere to stop and unload luggage.		80009150	We would always recommend driving to the hotel first to drop off any luggage to our front office team, then trying to find a parking spot.	
3271052	50008583	It's right on a busy junction.		80009151	With the John Lewis car park so close to us, you will always find a space near the hotel if our car park is full.	
3271052	50008584	The car parking is very limited and is ¬£15 a day.		80009152	I am pleased to read that our reception and house-keeping staff are continuing to provide an attentive and efficient service.	
3271052	50008585	The entrance to the car park is on Bute Terrace about 10 metres before the traffic light.		80009153	Your glowing report of our breakfast is exactly the kind of feedback we thrive on ‚Äì a great deal of thought has gone into the sumptuous spread on offer.	
3271052	50008586	Buzz the intercom for parking.		80009154	I am surprised that your business class room was not as big as you expected it to be ‚Äì many of our guests comment on how wonderfully spacious our rooms and suites are.	
3271052	50008587	Reception and cleaning staff are fast and attentive, although the cleaner left a large chunk of broken glass by the bed.		80009155	Guest sleep quality is usually extremely high in our comfortable beds, I am disappointed that this was not the case with yourself.	
3271052	50008588	Breakfast is a highlight.		80009156	Providing a fast, convenient internet connection is just one of the many Radisson Blu standards you can always count on, so I am pleased we came up trumps here.	
3271052	50008589	It's a good breakfast, although there is nowhere to set down your plate as you take the lid of pots.		80009157	We are very proud of our hotel standards and normally exceed our guests‚Äô expectations.	
3271052	50008590	I expected the business suite room to be far bigger than it was.		80009158	I hope you will return and give us another chance to wow you with our service and facilities.	
3271052	50008591	In fact it's the same room as a standard room but with free movies, don't waste your money.		80009159	Kind Regards, Jens	
3271052	50008592	The beds are too soft, so you get back ache.				
3271052	50008593	The lifts give out too many annoying verbal announcements.				
3271052	50008594	The wifi is good though, and fast.				

3295407	50008600	charity event ---SEP---		80009160	Dear Guest, Thank you very much for this great review and for sharing your recent experience at the Savoy Hotel.	
3295407	50008601	Was recently invited to a charity event held at the Savoy in Bournemouth,i must say its in a great location, perfectly situated for the beach and town.		80009161	I am delighted to hear you had a great time and appreciated our very central location.	
3295407	50008602	Would like to thank the manager and his fantastic staff for the service we received.		80009162	I am also glad our staff looked after you well and I will pass your lovely comments.	
3295407	50008603	The food was very good.		80009163	Kindest Regards	
3295407	50008604	And i think everybody who attended had a lovely day.				

3321582	50008610	Relaxing Retreat ---SEP---		80009174	Dear Colleen, Thank you for staying with us and sharing your experience online.	
3321582	50008611	The pool area is a winner with the heated pool and the small beach in the pool for children, with extra fun fountains.		80009175	We are delighted to know that you thoroughly enjoyed.	
3321582	50008612	Very clean and comfortable beds.		80009176	Until we have the pleasure of welcoming you back, we wish you safe travels and all the best.	
3321582	50008613	Loved the location next to the long pier.		80009177	Kind regards, John	
3321582	50008614	Staff friendly and helpful.				

3234855	50008620	Nashville's Finest!		80009188	Thank you for taking a moment to submit a review of your recent stay at our property.	
3234855	50008621	---SEP---		80009189	We are very pleased you found the location to be so ideal and that you enjoyed your stay overall.	
3234855	50008622	I stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.		80009190	We appreciate your feedback and do hope to see you again soon!	
3234855	50008623	Staff was super friendly and would go out of their way to help you.				
3234855	50008624	Room and hotel decor was beautiful.				
3234855	50008625	Location was perfect - you could walk down to all the local bars and restaurants.				
3234855	50008626	I highly recommend this hotel.				

3195393	50008630	One Night Stay ---SEP---		80009201	Good morning Thomas Y, Thank you for taking the time to place feedback on your stay with us - we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your time with us.	
3195393	50008631	This is a hotel that is definitely very good for transit or a one night stay.		80009202	We are proud to have our newly renovated hotel rooms and public areas and take on your feedback that the rooms require hangers for coats etc - this is some thing we are currently working on.	
3195393	50008632	The exterior may not looks appealing that's because they have kept the building facade as well as the exterior unchanged, but the renovated interior of the room is definitely delight you.		80009203	Kind regards, Melissa Alexander General Manager	
3195393	50008633	Almost every things you in the room is new, hence what you get is a clean and fresh room.				
3195393	50008634	Tea, chocolate and coffee are standard in almost all hotels in NZ, hence it is a no surprise to me.				
3195393	50008635	If I have to be critical then I would say it will be good to equip with some clothes hangers on the wall do that we don't have to place the clothing in the beds or chairs.				
3195393	50008636	While I understand the room is small and have no space for a closet, but a few hangers on the wall or on the door should do a great service to the guests.				
3195393	50008637	Wifi in the hotel is slow as expected, but it is still far better than my roaming SIM which is on a 3G network with a snail crawling speed.				
3195393	50008638	Hotel is right in the heart of the Fox Glacier town, as such dinning options are plentiful.				
3195393	50008639	It is definitely an experience not to be missed to dine in a cozy, cooling, relaxing and peaceful town which I enjoyed very much.				
3195393	50008640	Having said that, was think many would agree that Fox Glacier town is a small town that is good for transit or just a night stay over, and Heartland Hotel Glacier Country should fit the requirements and satisfy Moses for a one night stay.				

3257722	50008650	Good hotel for airport access ---SEP--- Stayed here one night after arriving in PHX for the start of a vacation.		80009214	Hello, Thank your taking the time to provide feedback on your stay here with us.	
3257722	50008651	Hotel is as you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express: nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable.		80009215	I'm happy to see that you enjoyed our complimentary breakfast served in our newly renovated Great Room.	
3257722	50008652	The breakfast is again as expected, good and hot, but nothing fancy.		80009216	We do apologize for the inconveniences experienced with the elevator.	
3257722	50008653	Hotel and property was pretty clean.		80009217	We have scheduled to have the issues resolved this week, so thank you for bringing this to our attention.	
3257722	50008654	Not much to eat in the immediate area.		80009218	Have a fantastic day!	
3257722	50008655	Only problems that we had were the room keys did not work initially and had to have the front desk re-do them.		80009219	Michael Martinez General Manager	
3257722	50008656	Had one issue with a key again during trip, so they may need to check room 409's lock.				
3257722	50008657	Also, the elevator door takes about 20 seconds before it will close and the close button does not work - a little annoying.				
3257722	50008658	Other than that, good place to stay for the start or end of a trip at PHX.				

3293769	50008660	Good location, average hotel ---SEP---		80009220	Thanks for your review.	
3293769	50008661	We were heading to the motorpoint arena for the evening and this Ibis is in the perfect location; only a couple minutes walk.		80009221	I am glad you had a good stay with us.	
3293769	50008662	Its also very close to the shops and restaurants in the centre of Cardiff.		80009222	See you on your next trip hopefully!	
3293769	50008663	Our room was okay, clean enough but nothing too fancy (as expected though)!		80009223	Kind regards Marc Lock	
3293769	50008664	Quite expensive for what it is, but the location was handy.				

3181779	50008670	Friendly Staff & good location ---SEP--- Stayed for 5 nights over Easter.		80009234	"Dear ""Crowey_12"", Thank you for taking the time to provide a review on the Pullman Auckland."	
3181779	50008671	Staff were really friendly and helpful with good suggestions on nearby places to visit and local amenities.		80009235	I am so pleased that you had a wonderful stay.	
3181779	50008672	Location is good but, it is Auckland so be prepared for some big hills if you're walking anywhere.		80009236	We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the future.	
3181779				80009237	Kind regards, Carly Saunders Quality and Attitude Manager	

3302985	50008680	Might as Well Be Homeless...		80009248	We appreciate it when a guest brings his/her dissatisfaction to our attention so that we may apologize and make amends for our shortcomings.	
3302985	50008681	---SEP--- Seeking disappointment?		80009249	This guest arrived with a reservation confirmation that he had canceled several hours after making the reservation.	
3302985	50008682	Well, you've come to the right place.		80009250	He admitted he received the cancellation notice from his travel agent.	
3302985	50008683	Guests contemplating stays here should arrive at the Seaport Hotel without any expectations that things like confirmed reservations will be fulfilled.		80009251	We were in a difficult situation: the hotel was sold out, along with much of the city.	
3302985	50008684	People, like me, silly enough to reserve a room through the hotel's reservation line, and confirm it with a credit card number, will long for a hotel where such things are actually honored.		80009252	We offered assistance in multiple ways over lengthy discussions yet he refused and demanded a room which we could not provide - it would displace a guest with a confirmed reservation.	
3302985	50008685	While some of the staff is amiable, others here seem out to prove that guests are nuisances, and above all that promises are not worth keeping, especially when bedraggled travelers show up armed with a flimsy confirmed reservation.		80009253	Unfortunately, although sincere, this guest‚Äôs memory is not supported by the documentation, both his and ours.	
3302985	50008686	Instead of confirmed reservations, potential guests at the Seaport Hotel should arrive with low expectations, especially for things that one might reasonably expect at other hotels.		80009254	Despite offers to help and expressions of concern, our offers were rebuffed.	
3302985	50008687	When these guest (the ones with low expectations) are then cast off like a homeless person, they will not be disappointed after all when they - despite careful planning - have to find shelter - and at the last minute - at some other waterfront SRO.		80009255	This is a very unfortunate circumstance and we regret this guest was unable to be satisfied.	
3302985				80009256	Kind regards, James M. Carmody Vice President & General Manager	

3280606	50008690	TRYP ---SEP---		80009267	Dear laceyjordan123 First and foremost I would like to truly apologize for the unfortunate incident you had with our shuttle service.	
3280606	50008691	Positives: Brand new hotel, modern, stylish and within close proximity to airport.		80009268	There seems to have been a lag in communication.	
3280606	50008692	There was a gym, a movie theatre and a convienience store inside the hotel.		80009269	Please contact me to rectify this situation.	
3280606	50008693	The pool looked beautiful but I did not have time to enjoy it.		80009270	I am pleased however that despite the tumultuous occurrence you were still able to enjoy all of our amenities and found that your accommodations were suitable to your traveling needs.	
3280606	50008694	The room had everything I needed and more and I would recommend this hotel based on these points.		80009271	Looking forward to hosting you in the near future.	
3280606	50008695	Negatives: I rang the hotel from the airport to request the airport shuttle (you can‚Äôt book this in advance)		80009272	Again please contact me whenever possible.	
3280606	50008696	I was told it would be 15-20 minutes		80009273	Marcos Oliveira General Manager 786.251.6942	
3280606	50008697	so I waited in the designated space but				
3280606	50008698	45-50 minutes later no shuttle arrived so I gave up and took a taxi.				
3280606	50008699	The second negative is that this cost $25 and the taxi driver had no idea where the hotel was even when I gave him the exact address.				

3262186	50008700	Loved It!		80009284	Thank you VERY much for your positive review of your stay with us at the Riviera.	
3262186	50008701	---SEP---		80009285	It was really pleasing to read that we had met, if not exceeded, your expectations	
3262186	50008702	The Riviera Guest House was a great base for a romantic 2 night break.		80009286	and it was very kind of you to take time out of your day to inform other guests of your experience.	
3262186	50008703	The views from room 2 were amazing and the actual room was the most comfortable we had stayed in for a long time.		80009287	The guesthouse is very lucky to have such beautiful panoramic views for our guests to enjoy, we are so pleased you found them so romantic (we have to agree!!).	
3262186	50008704	The only problem with bathroom was the fact that the bath narrowed down in the middle making it difficult to get two people in at the same time!		80009288	I am also pleased you found Room 2 to be so comfy and found the atmosphere to be really friendly.	
3262186	50008705	I can't understand the comments about the small size of the cooked breakfast.		80009289	We would like to thank you for your comments about the breakfast as we have trialled various sizes of breakfast over the past three years and believe we have found a size which suits most people (Bacon, Sausage, Hash Brown, Mushrooms, Beans, Tomoato and a choice of Egg).	
3262186	50008706	It was plenty big enough for us, but like most of the guests staying at the same time we also had as much cereal and toast as we wanted.		80009290	As you mention, guests can also help themself to as much cereal, toast, fruit and yoghurt as they would like.	
3262186	50008707	You couldn't find more friendlier hosts than Emma and Zed.		80009291	Some guests even have two Full English's so we'd like to think our guests go away with full tums!	
3262186	50008708	We will be back!		80009292	It was lovely to meet you both and are really looking forward to your stay with us again soon :-)	
3262186				80009293	Many thanks again :-)	

3290034	50008710	Familyholiday/ski trip ---SEP--- Great place to stay.		80009304	Thank you for taking the time to review your stay.	
3290034	50008711	Walking distance to the town shops and restaurants.		80009305	It is a pleasure to know that you found the Elk + Avenue a great place to stay and that the Loft rooms situated next to each other were perfect and comfortable.	
3290034	50008712	Bus stop out the front for buses to Lake Louise & Sunshine and to the Banff Gondola.		80009306	We hope to see you again.	
3290034	50008713	Stayed in two loft rooms next to each other which were perfect.		80009307	Warm Regards, Daren Hill Front Office Manager Elk + Avenue Hotel	
3290034	50008714	Beds upstairs (which were very comfortable) which gave plenty of room in the main room for lounging.				

3246075	50008720	Exceptional hotel...		80009318	Dear Guest, Thank you for your lovely review and kind words about the staff.	
3246075	50008721	Worth the stay ---SEP---		80009319	We are so pleased you enjoyed your time with us and very much hope to see you back again to The Savoy very soon.	
3246075	50008722	The Savoy hotel is one of the best hotels to stay at.		80009320	Kind regards, Kiaran MacDonald	
3246075	50008723	With old school butler service that is to die for...				
3246075	50008724	No request is out of reach from the butler or hotel team.				
3246075	50008725	The tea room is only one of the best in hotels.				
3246075	50008726	If i couldn't stay there I would still go for high tea...				
3246075	50008727	Excellent excellent service..				
3246075	50008728	One of the best managed Fairmonts besides The Plaza...				
3246075	50008729	But the Savoy is on a level of there own.				
3246075	50008730	I highly recommend Savoy for any occasion...				

3294985	50008740	BEST BEACH, FANTASTIC LOCATION ---SEP---		80009331	Thank you for your positive comments, we will look forward to your next visit as a return guest.	
3294985	50008741	We won a night and bought a night!		80009332	Cheers Tim Hackett	
3294985	50008742	We loved our room and every single person who interacted with us (Staff) was amazing, warm and friendly.				
3294985	50008743	Some went out of their way to make us comfortable.				
3294985	50008744	The great room was beautiful, the food was a bit overpriced for the quantity but everything was good.				
3294985	50008745	Going back in March !				
3294985	50008746	Will definitely recommend.				
3294985	50008747	It would be nice if there was a spa attached to it.				

3172680	50008750	LOVELY STAFF BUT !!!!!!!!		80009343	Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback.	
3172680	50008751	---SEP---		80009344	I am so pleased that Kate offered her usual high standard of service.	
3172680	50008752	Just came back from a meal at this hotel and as the title says we were greeted by a lovely girl called Kate she was busy but still took time out to say hello can she help etc.		80009345	I am however sorry for the delays you experienced.	
3172680	50008753	We were then shown to the bar we did have to wait even though there were a few staff standing about		80009346	I have already passed on your kind comments to Kate and will let the Head Chef have your comments about the food.	
3172680	50008754	but we got served eventually.		80009347	We hope to be able to welcome you back again soon.	
3172680	50008755	As we were waiting and then waiting to go to our table we looked around and to be honest it does need an upgrade some of it looks dated.we were then seated we had a nice table next to the window so we could see George square and do some people watching .				
3172680	50008756	The girl came asked us for drinks order ( the drinks came after we had our starters).We had the haggis bon bond for starters which were lovely , I had the rib eye steak and wife had chicken.				
3172680	50008757	The food was lovely and without sounding greedy we were still hungry after as they were very small portions that‚Äôs due to the groupon deal				
3172680	50008758	I suppose.				
3172680	50008759	I hope hotel reads this review so you can pass on a big thanks to your staff member Kate üëç				

3201367	50008760	Breathtaking and so peaceful		80009358	Thank you for your wonderful review, we really appreciate guests taking the time to review us, and love it even more when they have enjoyed their stay.	
3201367	50008761	---SEP---		80009359	Thank thank you!!	
3201367	50008762	I'm pretty sure my jaw hit the floor when we walked into Cottage #3...both the cottage itself which was incredibly luxurious, but the view, the view, the VIEW!		80009360	Bryan and Joan	
3201367	50008763	Although we spent our four days out exploring (and barely scratched the surface of things to do), I could have just as happily sat and watched the ocean for hours...				
3201367	50008764	Bryan has so thoughtfully provisioned and outfitted the cottage, and provided super helpful arrival information in advance - plus was always available for questions, help...and more coffee! :-)				
3201367	50008765	The koalas were amazing to see, at least for 'foreigners'.				
3201367	50008766	Don't miss the breweries in Forrest and Apollo Bay - IF you can drag yourself away from Points South!				
3201367	50008767	Outstanding, excellent value, and highly recommended.				

3270958	50008770	Kinsale hotel ---SEP--- Great hotel, amazing staff very helpful friendly upgrade to executive on the check in yummy breakfast thanks to to the girl in the reception and also to jenny and doroty from the bar.		80009371	Dear Nune, Thank you for your review of your recent stay with us in the Trident Hotel.

3270958				80009374	Kind regards, Hal McElroy Managing Director	

3296123	50008780	Our Canadian Holiday ---SEP--- Long Beach Lodge Resort in Tofino, British Columbia is without doubt a magical place to stay.		80009385	Thank you for your very positive review, I am delighted you enjoyed your holiday at the lodge and visit to Canada.	
3296123	50008781	The staff, food and location could not be better.		80009386	We wish you didn't live as far away as well, but hope you can visit us again in the future.	
3296123	50008782	The Hotel is situatied on the very edge of the beach with giant rollers tumbling in - we were watching the surfers while sitting on our private balcony enjoying a gin & tonic - couldn't wish for more.		80009387	Tim Hackett	
3296123	50008783	Wish it was nearer home.				

3306595	50008790	Good Hotel ---SEP---		80009398	Dear abbik, Thank you for taking the time to write a review, we apologise that you were disappointed with the view but completely agree that the seaview rooms are worth it!	
3306595	50008791	We stayed here for 2 nights.		80009399	Hope to welcome you back again in the future, Laura and all the team at Fistral Beach Hotel	
3306595	50008792	The room was very spacious and clean.				
3306595	50008793	The hotel is in a great location with amazing views.				
3306595	50008794	The staff were very good and friendly.				
3306595	50008795	The spa and gym are of an excellent standard.				
3306595	50008796	The only bad thing was the disappointing view from our room, and the lack of local tourist information availible to us on the reception.				
3306595	50008797	We would stay here again and would recommended a stay here.				

3247968	50008800	Nice hotel ---SEP---		80009400	Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the hotel.	
3247968	50008801	The hotel was very clean and pleasant.		80009401	I am delighted to see it was an enjoyable experience	
3247968	50008802	Quite noisy due to being close to the road, but at least you could open the window to get some fresh air in		80009402	and I hope you will choose to stay with us again.	
3247968	50008803	so I didn't mind the noise too much.		80009403	Kind Regards Jonathan Hay Deputy General Manager	
3247968	50008804	Room was clean.				
3247968	50008805	Shower was very powerful.				
3247968	50008806	Staff were really nice & helped where they could (getting a reservation for a restaurant)				

3322293	50008810	wonderful stay ---SEP---		80009414	Hi kristin_elite, We appreciate you taking the time to write a review about your stay at Vive Hotel Waikiki.	
3322293	50008811	The hotel is very clean and the breakfast is very good as well.		80009415	We're very happy to see that you've rated us so highly based on our service, cleanliness, and location.	
3322293	50008812	All staffs are friendly and I will go back again in the future.		80009416	It's great to read that you'd come back to us again in the future, as we'd be excited to provide you with accommodations again.	
3322293	50008813	Also, the hotel is located at a great location that I can access to all convenient stores or the beach or shopping.		80009417	Thank you for your business and take care.	
3322293				80009418	Best regards, Michael	

3298317	50008820	Debra Thomson ---SEP---		80009429	Thanks for the great review Debra!	
3298317	50008821	The outdoor deck is a great place for a delicious meal a few drinks and the view is wonderful Very relaxing atmosphere with live music on Sunday afternoons Does get busy so arrive early Great for a family gathering or event		80009430	We're so happy to hear that you enjoyed your visit.	
3298317				80009431	Please come back and see us again soon!	

3323059	50008830	Value, Comfortable and Convenient ---SEP---		80009442	Thanks for taking the time to review The Buccaneer Lodge - we are so glad you enjoyed your stay.	
3323059	50008831	The room was reasonably priced, comfortable, clean and convenient to get to after getting off the ferry.		80009443	Our apologies for the lack of water pressure - after seeing your comments we got the plumber in and there was an issue with the upstairs pressure - all sorted now.	
3323059	50008832	Nice to have the chickens to provide fresh eggs to go with the still warm freshly-baked bread in the kitchen!				
3323059	50008833	My only disappointment was with the bathroom in our unit which did not have a plug for electric razor/hair dryer etc and the shower had very poor water pressure, which did not get warm enough for me to enjoy my morning shower.				

3287998	50008840	Banff fairmont ---SEP--- Unforgettable experience.		80009454	Thank you for recommending us on Trip Advisor!	
3287998	50008841	Treated like royalty and the hotel was amazing.		80009455	It is truly appreciated.	
3287998	50008842	Rooms were very clean staff was very helpful.		80009456	The Fairmont Banff Springs	
3287998	50008843	The view of the bow falls were amazing from our room.				
3287998	50008844	I would recomend this hotel to anyone.				

3211312	50008850	Abbey Hotel, Roscommon ---SEP--- Welcoming Staff, who were extremely helpful and kind to my husband and I after I had a fall.		80009467	Thank you Bett for your positive feedback, I will ensure that your comments are passed along to Management & Staff.	
3211312	50008851	Lovely food and great atmosphere in lounge, would certainly recommend.		80009468	We hope to see you soon again.	
3211312	50008852	Relaxing hotel and very central for the town centre.				

3255791	50008860	Helpful in a crisis ---SEP---		80009479	Dear Suzanne C It‚Äôs such an honour to read your review and note the amazing service provided by our wonderful associates in ensuring your well-being and comfort is our priority in this unfortunate situation.	
3255791	50008861	I was travelling for work this week using the sheraton's board rooms and staying there for four nights.		80009480	Thank you for your kind words and praise!	
3255791	50008862	However a massive migraine struck which saw me leaving meetings early, retiring to my room in a pretty bad way.		80009481	Warm regards Bernhard Langer Hotel Manager	
3255791	50008863	I caved and rang for the hotel doctor.				
3255791	50008864	Was there even such a thing?				
3255791	50008865	Fortunately there was and whilst it took a little while -30mins - to get there the Sheraton staff were concerned and careful.				
3255791	50008866	They enquired about first aid being required, if they could provide anything else, they rang back to ensure the dr had called and rang later to make sure all was ok and even sent extra housekeeping.				
3255791	50008867	If my husband wasn't here I would have accepted more of their help, fortunately I didn't need to.				
3255791	50008868	So the service in a crisis was a bonus and over and above their usual high standards of presentation and accommodation.				
3255791	50008869	Would recommend the business facilities and staff to friends, family and fellow business travellers.				
3255791	50008870	Thanks Sheraton team				

3326199	50008880	Benbradagh &Errigal Walkers ---SEP--- Lovely warm and hospitable welcome at The River Bar today where we had lunch.		80009492	Dear Catlin	
3326199	50008881	We had pre-booked lunch and the staff had a nice spacious area set and reserved for us.		80009493	Many thanks for taking the time to write your review during your recent visit to our River Bar for lunch at The Crowne Plaza Belfast.	
3326199	50008882	It adds so much to have friendly helpful staff - and the young man who was our main waiter alongside his colleagues certainly provided this with their relaxed helpful manner and smiling faces.		80009494	We are delighted that you really enjoyed our excellent service & food from the team, the lovely atmosphere in the relaxed setting for your pre-booked lunch.	
3326199	50008883	They really are an asset.		80009495	Glad you had a lovely day.	
3326199	50008884	The service was prompt and food delicious .		80009496	A warm welcome awaits your next return visit to The Crowne Plaza Belfast.	
3326199	50008885	We had enjoyed a beautiful walk locally and our lunch added very much to the day.		80009497	Regards Geraldine McLarnon	
3326199	50008886	Well done and thank-you				

3243583	50008890	Excellent ---SEP---		80009508	Dear Anna S, Thank you taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community.	
3243583	50008891	All the staff at Meriton were professional and attentive.		80009509	We are delighted to read you enjoyed our five star standards in customer service and quality accommodation at Meriton Suites Mascot Central and do hope you were able to take some time to relax and unwind in our resort style leisure facilities throughout your stay.	
3243583	50008892	Nothing was too much trouble.		80009510	Anna S, we do look forward to welcoming you back to Meriton Suites in the near future, across Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast.	
3243583	50008893	Modern apartments fitted out with every needed for a comfortable stay.		80009511	Kind regards Todd M Online Reputation Team	
3243583	50008894	Easy access to CBD, airport and surrounding areas.				
3243583	50008895	Excellent.				

3219366	50008900	If future travels take us back to Fernie, you can expect us back at Red Tree Lodge!		80009522	Hello Fairburn3310, Thank you for your review!	
3219366	50008901	---SEP---		80009523	Andre was very pleased to see your review and hear that you enjoyed your stay.	
3219366	50008902	We recently spent one night at Red Tree Lodge, our first time in Fernie and just a quick stop over during our 10 day BC road trip with our 21 month old.		80009524	I'm glad you found us to be so comfortable and we'll look forward to seeing you on your visit to Fernie.	
3219366	50008903	We were very impressed with Red Tree Lodge.		80009525	Until next time, Jon Ward General Manager Red Tree Lodge	
3219366	50008904	Not only are they just a 10 minute walk from downtown, but the lodging itself is very comfortable.				
3219366	50008905	The staff seemed very friendly, in particular, Andre at the front desk.				
3219366	50008906	The room and bathroom were cleaner than a chain hotel we had stayed at earlier in our trip, and although we didn't have the chance to take advantage of them, there's a kitchen, pool, sauna, movie room, and more!				
3219366	50008907	We don't get away very often but if we do ever get back to Fernie (and we would love to!), Red Tree Lodge is where we will stay.				
3219366	50008908	Thanks for the lovely experience!				

3302835	50008910	Space, and Solitude?, in Vegas ---SEP--- Being connected to The Venetian makes The Palazzo big even by Vegas standards.		80009536	Dear Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience.	
3302835	50008911	But it is also a little less hectic, a little more elegant, and very self-contained.		80009537	I am pleased to read of your satisfaction	
3302835	50008912	The Venetian/Palazzo property really is a city within Vegas and this can be good and bad.		80009538	and I look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	
3302835	50008913	The Good: Every room is a spacious, well-appointed suite.		80009539	Kind Regards, Kirsten Dimond VP of Hotel Operations	
3302835	50008914	These rooms would be significant upgrades in most other Vegas hotels and, frankly, not even available in many.				
3302835	50008915	Bathrooms are huge, beds comfy, noise levels very low, and furnishings top-notch with my favorite feature being a sunken living room with comfortable sectional couch and large TV for chilling out in.				
3302835	50008916	"You can really escape from ""Vegas"" in your room."				
3302835	50008917	The casino and bars are not packed and are similarly appointed.				
3302835	50008918	The Venetian/Palazzo restaurant choices are exceptional and the Canyon Ranch Spa/Fitness Center is decadent.				
3302835	50008919	Oh, and if you are in town for a conference there is direct access to the Sands Convention Center.				
3302835	50008920	The Bad: You may never leave.				
3302835	50008921	This is a phenomenon that, as a frequent traveler, I hate.				
3302835	50008922	Vegas, to me, is a place to get out in and explore the different nooks and crannies that make it unique.				
3302835	50008923	There are great bars, restaurants, shows, and clubs in every hotel ‚Ä¶				
3302835	50008924	I like to get around and experience the variety.				
3302835	50008925	One really can't criticize much about this property- truly.				
3302835	50008926	But I like to wander and Palazzo keeps me too close.				

3200466	50008930	A Convenient Hotel To Walk and Explore Downtown Banff ---SEP---		80009540	Thank you for your choice of our hotel and for taking the time to review your stay.	
3200466	50008931	After our snowcoach tour of the Columbia icefield and Bowfalls, we stopped for a night stay at Banff International Hotel.		80009541	It is great to hear that you enjoyed our location and its proximity to great dining and shopping.	
3200466	50008932	The hotel is located in the mid-downtown Banff and is very convenient walking distance to most shops and places to eat.		80009542	It is also very rewarding for us to know a guest found our beds comfortable because a sound night's sleep is so important when traveling.	
3200466	50008933	We had dinner at this popular restaurant The Grizzly House nearby, that served Fondues and exotic meats on Hot Rocks.		80009543	Warm Regards, Daren Hill Front Office Manager Brewster Hospitality	
3200466	50008934	The hotel guestroom is nice with comfy beds and they served a light buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurants specially catered for tour groups.

3209469	50008950	Wonderful Stay ---SEP---		80009567	Hello Linda Thank you for taking the time to write this lovely review.	
3209469	50008951	Just home from a lovely stay in Hotel Ballina.		80009568	The staff and Management will be delighted to read this.	
3209469	50008952	Our room, a junior suite was very spacious and spotlessly clean.		80009569	I am delighted you enjoyed your stay and especially Eidin Spa as this has been redecorated and re branded recently.	
3209469	50008953	Bed was so very comfortable.		80009570	Thank you again.	
3209469	50008954	Breakfast was fantastic, very very tasty, as too was the lovely lunch we had in McShanes bar.		80009571	Kind Regards, Siobhan Scally General Manager	
3209469	50008955	Had a very relaxing treatment also in the beautiful spa, great for some rest and to get away from it all for awhile.				
3209469	50008956	Plenty of parking and a fully equipped gym which we also took advantage of.				
3209469	50008957	The hotel staff are absolutely fantastic and I cannot commend them highly enough.				
3209469	50008958	Keep up the good work üëçüòä				

3224073	50008960	Perfect ---SEP---		80009582	Dear Minisponger Thanks for writing such a perfect review - I am so pleased that you had a fab time with us.	
3224073	50008961	What can I say, took my girlfriend here for her 21st for a weekend.		80009583	Glad to read that you will be back soon	
3224073	50008962	We had an incredible time!		80009584	and I look forward to welcoming you.	
3224073	50008963	The room (we got a free upgrade to an ocean view) was spotless, view was amazing, couldn't have asked for more.		80009585	Kind regards Luke and the team at Fistral Beach Hotel & Spa	
3224073	50008964	The food from the hotel was delicious, tried a few different things, the burger was beautiful, but the eggs royal were a personal favourite at breakfast, and since continental breakfast came with any of the cooked food I personally couldn't manage all the food when I ordered the full fry up anyway.				
3224073	50008965	And even though it is expensive, it really is worth it for everything we tried.				
3224073	50008966	The pool and spa area are gorgeous.				
3224073	50008967	And the relaxation room really was a joy to be in while waiting for the girlfriend to have a facial and massage, which I'm told was also fantastic.				
3224073	50008968	The staff in the hotel couldn't have been more helpful, it really did seem like nothing was too much trouble for them.				
3224073	50008969	If I had to be VERY picky, I did feel the drinks were a bit on the expensive side, ¬£4 a pint seems silly.				
3224073	50008970	But saying that I would, and in fact will be, staying here again as soon as I can.				
3224073	50008971	All in all a great place to stay, or eat.				
3224073	50008972	I just wish I didn't have to go back to work				
3224073	50008973	so I could have stayed longer!				

3320000	50008980	Amazing customer service - meetings and events		80009596	Dear Indy0081 Thank you so much for your generous feedback!	
3320000	50008981	---SEP--- I wanted to put an email together today to explain how very impressed I have been with the support Denis has demonstrated today.		80009597	It has been an absolute pleasure to read.	
3320000	50008982	We have very important clients who have flown in to run an assessment centre today.		80009598	I am always so proud to see our ambassadors names mentioned on Trip Advisor, especially when they have gone above and beyond to ensure the satisfaction of our valued guests.	
3320000	50008983	We had scheduled a meeting at 8.00am today before the assessment.		80009599	Denis really is a fantastic member of our team and it is through moments like this that his service is exemplified.	
3320000	50008984	I was leading this		80009600	He is equally delighted to have been personally recognised for his efforts and we thank you for your encouraging words.	
3320000	50008985	and I was the one with all the paperwork needed.		80009601	We can only hope that his display of customer service will determine you to return to our hotel in the future for many more Magnifique experiences.	
3320000	50008986	( enough to fill a small case ) Unfortunately, there was a horrendous accident on the M4 and my junction was closed and as you can imagine everyone had been diverted causing gridlock.		80009602	Kind regards, Ryan Nicholls ‚Äì General Manager Sofitel London Heathrow	
3320000	50008987	I called the hotel to explain and Denis very kindly took receipt of a number of emails and photocopied documents that were needed and delivered them to the room.				
3320000	50008988	He also confirmed to me that this had been done, as he could tell I was worried.				
3320000	50008989	I arrived 3 hours late and the client wasn‚Äôt really any wiser as everything had gone smoothly.				
3320000	50008990	He continued to be informative and supportive and got my Wi-Fi up and running too.				
3320000	50008991	Now, I appreciate its his job, but nevertheless, he was professional and attentive and added that extra bit of calm which was important today and I wanted you to know what an excellent customer experience I have had today.

3248046	50009010	Beautiful hotel, poor service ---SEP---		80009627	Dear Lilacstrawberry Thank you for your review of your recent visit.	
3248046	50009011	The highlight of this hotel is clearly the beautiful view.		80009628	I am pleased to hear that you found your room to be comfortable and that you particularly enjoyed your time spent in GONG.	
3248046	50009012	Rooms are comfortable and, as new, extremely improved in respect to other Shangri-las.		80009629	I am disappointed to hear that on this occasion our cleaning standard was not at its normal high level and would like to hear further feedback so that I can pass this on to our Executive Housekeeper.	
3248046	50009013	I also enjoyed Gong very much: kind service and great cocktails.		80009630	Please could you provide some additional information and email it to claire.hepworth@shangri-la.com with your review title and username.	
3248046	50009014	However, cleaning service in the room was poor, and I think that for GBP 600 at night they could include breakfast.		80009631	We do hope that you will return again in the future.	
3248046				80009632	Kind regards, Jurgen Jurgen Ammerstorfer, Hotel Manager	

3273454	50009020	Good ---SEP---		80009643	Thank you for your review.	
3273454	50009021	The room was nice, but the cleaning staff did not change our sheets between the 2 nights and there was lots of dust on lamps and such, as well, they left an ashtray full and forgot 1 of the garbages.		80009644	If there is ever an issue please call the Front Desk so they can assist you.	
3273454	50009022	I loved the fact there was 2 air conditioners/heaters!		80009645	I have passed on your comments to the House Keep department.	
3273454				80009646	That is not a normal occurrence for us.	
3273454				80009647	We always strive to provide excellent customer service.	
3273454				80009648	I do hope you give us another chance in the near future.	

3206264	50009030	Lovely place to stay ---SEP---		80009659	Dear B0bla Thankyou for choosing to stay at the Kangaroo Island Seafront and taking the time to share your thoughts.	
3206264	50009031	This hotel is on the esplanade overlooking the beautiful ocean a and greenery of KI.		80009660	It was pleasing to read that you had an enjoyable stay with us and enjoyed the town of Penneshaw.	
3206264	50009032	Greeted by a lovely lady who gave us a full run down of the hotel and penneshaw..		80009661	We hope to welcome you to the Kangaroo Island Seafront again.	
3206264	50009033	Due to previous tripadvisor posts about the seafront room I was expecting it to be small, but was happily surprised.		80009662	Kind Regards, Management	
3206264	50009034	Very comfortable size for a couple with a lovely balcony overlooking the ocean.				
3206264	50009035	Cafes, hotels and take away all within walking distance.				
3206264	50009036	Glad we chose penneshaw to stay and not kingscote				

3300131	50009040	Excellent ---SEP---		80009673	Hi Donna, Thanks so much for your kind words.	
3300131	50009041	In kitchen was very clean, washing and drying facilities were excellent.		80009674	I really appreciate you taking the time to pass on your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3300131	50009042	The bedding smelt and felt fresh and at Manly outside was very noisy but in the room was sound proof.		80009675	Kind Regards, Mark Stanley General Manager	
3300131	50009043	My family had a peaceful sleep.				

3217312	50009050	Ronald McDonald Gala ---SEP---		80009686	DoctorVonCueBall-Thank you for your comments regarding the recent event attended at the Waterside.	
3217312	50009051	Well when you have a major event it might be nice to have more than 2 food items to eat at the cocktail party and to have more than 1 bar tender at each station with 500 people at a major event.		80009687	We were certainly proud to host the Ronald McDonald gala and partner for such a worthy cause.	
3217312	50009052	Then upon leaving the valets lost our car and could not find it for 30'minutes.		80009688	Of course we extend an apology for any concerns during the event, and particularly regarding the encounter with valet.	
3217312	50009053	Not impressive at all.		80009689	Please know that we strive to provide a flawless experience for each and every guest, and look forward to providing an experience more consistent with our expectations in the future.	
3217312	50009054	The GM has a place in need of lots of retraining.				
3217312	50009055	the Doctor				

3213940	50009060	Amazing view!		80009690	Thanks Hazel.	
3213940	50009061	---SEP---		80009691	Our Retreat, being outside of the township, exudes peace and tranquility, just what most travelers need when they get here - which take some effort.	
3213940	50009062	This cabin was ideal for our one night stay.		80009692	We are not for the party types, that's for the town accommodation.	
3213940	50009063	The kitchen facilities were excellent and I cooked our evening meal.		80009693	"We hope you have the time to visit our ""peace"" of paradise again soon."	
3213940	50009064	We enjoyed it while looking out at the amazing view of the glacier area and watched the colours changing in the evening sun.				
3213940	50009065	Only complaint we had was that we could not stay longer!

3227712	50009074	They really couldn't do enough for us.				
3227712	50009075	I will go back next time I'm in Dublin				

3285015	50009080	very nice friendly and professional Hotel ---SEP--- we stayed there for 2 night and the Hotel was very clean, friendly professional staff and they always gave a warm smile and were happy to be working for the Hotel and the guest.		80009718	Aloha!

3234972	50009100	Mrs Pearson ---SEP---		80009745	Dear Mrs Pearson, Many thanks for taking the time to review your recent stay at the Royal Station Hotel.	
3234972	50009101	My husband booked two nights as a surprise for our ruby wedding celebration,on our arrival we had a letter from the hotel wishing us a happy anniversary along with two bottles of wine and two boxes of chocolates such a nice touch we had a lovely weekend the food in the restaurant was beautiful.		80009746	We are thrilled to hear that you and your husband had a lovely wedding anniversary weekend stay with us.	
3234972	50009102	,the room was very comfortable,thank you to all concerned.		80009747	We look forward to seeing you again in the near future.	
3234972				80009748	Kindest Regards Royal Station Hotel	

3216531	50009110	1st visit in 2018 was great, but downhill and disappointing this time around.		80009759	Thank you for your review of your stay with us while traveling to Denver.	
3216531	50009111	---SEP---		80009760	I am so sorry that you experienced the issues above, we did not meet your expectations nor did we meet our own.	
3216531	50009112	This is our second time staying at Hotel Born in Denver, we‚Äôre partial to Kimpton hotels and our first experience here in 2018 was great.		80009761	I can assure you we will be following up with both the front desk and the housekeeping departments so they understand the importance of following through on details and coaching them on other parking options that are around the hotel if you did not want to park with us.	
3216531	50009113	My husband and I eloped and stayed here during our trip.		80009762	This review was very hard for me to read as all of our management team holds our employees to such high standards and this is very out of the ordinary for our team as you can see from the previous reviews of the hotel but this is being taken very seriously.	
3216531	50009114	We decided to make a return trip one year later and made it a priority to book Born for our stay, however this experience has been disappointing from the first steps in the door.		80009763	Hope you had safe travels home from your trip and hope you have a wonderful rest of your summer.	
3216531	50009115	To name a few, here are some of the unsatisfactory experiences or conditions we‚Äôve had in our first hour on property: 1.				
3216531	50009116	Rude, confrontational, sarcastic parking security attendant.				
3216531	50009117	Watched us park in an unloading area and wheel in our luggage, then followed us inside to the check in desk to abrasively interrupt with ‚ÄúHEY!				
3216531	50009118	Is that y‚Äôalls car.				
3216531	50009119	You gotta move it now‚Äù We‚Äôre not stupid, we know parking is offsite and we‚Äôve stayed here before.)				
3216531	50009120	2.				
3216531	50009121	Check-in host was unhelpful when asked how and where to park, or even for any nearby parking garage recommendations.				
3216531	50009122	His response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs hard for me to find a spot when I come to work, so...good luck.‚Äù				
3216531	50009123	3.				
3216531	50009124	We checked into our room after a long day of travel.				
3216531	50009125	Walked in and for some reason the bedside table drawer was pulled all the way out and left open.				
3216531	50009126	Strange, but nothing I would normally care about.				
3216531	50009127	What bothers me is when there is long hair still in the bathroom floor.				
3216531	50009128	Worst of all, there is dried blood and/or body fluids on the tile around the base of the toilet.				
3216531	50009129	It‚Äôs not hard to miss, it was first thing I saw when I opened the door.				
3216531	50009130	So now I‚Äôve put my shoes back on to walk around the room, trying to be wary of what‚Äôs been cleaned and what hasn‚Äôt.				
3216531	50009131	I‚Äôm not sure if the cleaning wasn‚Äôt thorough or if we were just placed in a room that had not yet been attended too.				
3216531	50009132	We‚Äôve yet to get a phone pickup on the front desk or guest service line.				
3216531	50009133	Moral of the story: don‚Äôt travel in on an evening flight and arriving for check in at 10pm, service is subpar and we‚Äôre still awake and exhausted at 2AM trying to just have a clean room to rest in.				

3188160	50009140	Great price for a Fairmont hotel ---SEP--- Centrally located on the Mountain about halfway up but to the side of everything.		80009774	Dear tbaum16, Thank you so much for your review.	
3188160	50009141	Great price and value when compared to other Fairmont hotels.		80009775	It is truly gratifying to receive such great comments and we are thrilled to know that you enjoyed your stay.

3242711	50009152	The staff were all friendly and treated me like a long lost family member.		80009790	Sincerely, Randy Rushakoff General Manager	
3242711	50009153	It is close to the interstate, and the free wifi and popcorn were a nice touch.				
3242711	50009154	I cannot recommend here highly enough.				

3294467	50009160	Central and friendly staff ---SEP---		80009801	Bonjour TWhite1307, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Sofitel Queenstown Hotel & Spa.

3291642	50009170	Don't panic ---SEP---		80009815	Dear Softballmom1234, Thank you for taking the time out of your day tu submit a review on your stay.	
3291642	50009171	When driving to this hotel I was a little worried because neighborhood looked somewhat shady.		80009816	We do realize that here in Ybor sometimes the area can look a bit sketchy but it's also related to Ybor being a very historic town as well.	
3291642	50009172	Several people under bridge drinking.		80009817	I am glad that you got to see what Ybor has to offer and experience it's entertainment value.	
3291642	50009173	Keep moving.		80009818	I will be sharing your review with our team and truly appreciate you choosing our property to stay at.	
3291642	50009174	Hotel and area are nice.		80009819	Look forward to seeiing you again!	
3291642	50009175	Hotel was clean and comfortable.				
3291642	50009176	Shuttle to cruise port provided.				
3291642	50009177	Breakfast was good.				
3291642	50009178	Not a lot for children in area but if you are a couple looking for fun this is good place for you.				

3169677	50009180	Beautiful! ---SEP---		80009820	Dear Jessie C Thanks so much for taking the time to post a review on Tripadvisor.

3163334	50009190	Views for days ---SEP---		80009834	Aloha B N, Thank you for your great comments and review of your visit with us.	
3163334	50009191	This is my first time staying here even though we‚Äôve been to the island more times than I can count.		80009835	We pride ourselves in offering great service to all our guests and it sounds like your first impression of our hotel was a good one.	
3163334	50009192	The shuttle we took dropped us off in the shuttle area and it was a walk to the lobby.		80009836	Having said that, we were sorry to read that we were not able to meet your every expectation during your stay.	
3163334	50009193	Granted not a long walk but after a flight and carrying bags it feels like a long haul (though not).		80009837	We do our best to maintain high standards and we continually strive to improve upon our service delivery.	
3163334	50009194	Check in was easy.		80009838	Candid comments like yours help us in this process, so we appreciate your feedback.	
3163334	50009195	Our room was on the 14th floor with an amazing view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond head.		80009839	Thank you again, and we hope to have the opportunity to provide you with an even better stay on your next visit.	
3163334	50009196	We paid for an ocean front room and I‚Äôm still not 100% sure the difference in general of paying for ocean view versus ocean front.		80009840	Mahalo, Mari K. Guest Experience Team	
3163334	50009197	We had told our family to book at the same hotel and we had 6 rooms.				
3163334	50009198	One of the party got upgraded to an ocean front and was directly over the infinity pool so had a true ocean front.				
3163334	50009199	That is what I thought we would get.				
3163334	50009200	However, I adored my view and it was actually the view I wanted.				
3163334	50009201	The hotel is going through some construction just FYI.				
3163334	50009202	The people that got upgraded to that ocean front room had issues though.				
3163334	50009203	Since they were on one of the floors that was being renovated, they could only take one side of the bays of elevator to get to their floor.				
3163334	50009204	This is an issue since the elevators are random and could come at any time, also there are a lot of guests so its dependent on a lot of factors.				
3163334	50009205	The members in that room also changed rooms since they were woken up by construction noise and there was sawdust you could smell and feel in the air.				
3163334	50009206	My room on the other hand didn‚Äôt have that issue.				
3163334	50009207	The room is a bit dated but I know that the updated rooms (the one that was ocean front) were quite modern.				
3163334	50009208	Our TV was a big issue.				
3163334	50009209	It worked the first day fine				
3163334	50009210	but then the next few days it wasn‚Äôt working and just had an antenna signal.				
3163334	50009211	We called down the first day and they said they knew about it and was working on it.				
3163334	50009212	Now I know people will say you‚Äôre in Hawaii you dont need one or whatever, but when you are in you‚Äôre room and getting ready or what not or even in bed, its nice to have a TV.				
3163334	50009213	On the second and third day we finally called down again and complained.				
3163334	50009214	They at least credited the resort fee.				
3163334	50009215	But to be honest the TV in general was still glitchy (good luck if you have kids).				
3163334	50009216	The infinity pool was beautiful and not as crowded as I had expected my only minor complaint is that the water was too warm but we still spent a lot of time in it.				
3163334	50009217	Overall good experience!				
3163334	50009218	I really like the location and even the shops within the hotel.				
3163334	50009219	My room even though dated (for now) had my ideal view of any hotel on the strip!				

3314713	50009220	Nice relaxed location ---SEP--- Nice comfortable rooms.		80009851	Dear Avin N, I just wanted to thank you for your recent stay here at our property and I am so glad that you were able to experience our authentic Hilton hospitality.	
3314713	50009221	Great views of Lake Wakaitapu.		80009852	Thank you for taking the time to post such lovely comments on TripAdvisor and we look forward to seeing you soon.	
3314713	50009222	Friendly staff.		80009853	Regards, Chris	
3314713	50009223	Slightly more expensive than other hotels in the area				
3314713	50009224	but it is Hilton.				
3314713	50009225	10 mins drive to Queenstown city centre.				
3314713	50009226	Pretty close but still far away to make your stay quiet and peaceful.				

3267516	50009230	It was a good choice ---SEP---		80009864	Dear Toni P, Thank you for your great review!	
3267516	50009231	We have stayed for seven days in Sydney on our trip in Australia.		80009865	Here at Meriton Kent Street we pride ourselves on our spacious apartments and state of the art leisure facilities, it is great that you made use of these during your stay!	
3267516	50009232	The apartment has a generous size and skyview on the 48th floor was fabulous.		80009866	We are only a short walk from many cafes and restaurants should you decide to venture out for a meal.	
3267516	50009233	Then there is a very nice gym with a swimming-pool and sauna.		80009867	Thank you again for taking the time to write this review, it is much appreciated!	
3267516	50009234	We have had problems with the keys of our appartment, because several times they didn't function.		80009868	King Regards, Crystal M Senior Manager on Duty	
3267516	50009235	In a nice kitchen we could cook meals for ourselve quite well.				
3267516	50009236	We also have used the washing/dryer-machine.				
3267516	50009237	The result wasn't good enough.				

3301507	50009240	DoubleTree by Hilton - Regina ---SEP---		80009879	Thanks Wayne P for your kind words on TripAdvisor!	
3301507	50009241	An excellent upscale property that provided a great room, great service and great food delivered by a truly friendly and genuine staff.		80009880	Have a great New Year!	
3301507	50009242	The upgrades to this hotel are evident and made our stay most enjoyable!		80009881	Mike Wurster General Manager	

3195264	50009250	Dog Friendly hotel ---SEP---		80009892	Hi	
3195264	50009251	I stayed here for one night.		80009893	Sunshinemap Thank you for your review of our Hotel.	
3195264	50009252	When I arrived there was no one at the desk but a lady was in front of me waiting.		80009894	I'm sorry to hear that there was some noise that disrupted your stay with us.	
3195264	50009253	After 5 minutes a man arrived and continued to serve her.		80009895	We are a dog friendly Hotel and I respect that there can be some noise, and we do everything we can to minimise the disruption to other guests.	
3195264	50009254	The check in itself was a normal check in.		80009896	I would be more than happy to allocate you a room in as quiet a location as possible for the future.	
3195264	50009255	My room was on the ground floor and through 2 fire doors.		80009897	I'm pleased that your room was comfortable and clean, and while we have a limited number of rooms with air conditioning I would be able to offer you one for the future.	
3195264	50009256	My room had no air conditioning but i did have a fan and the window was left open which is not a good choice on the ground floor.		80009898	I do hope that we get the chance to welcome you back to the Hotel for a more relaxing and enjoyable stay soon!	
3195264	50009257	the room itself was comfortable and clean with 2 twin beds.		80009899	Kind Regards, Graham	
3195264	50009258	I was woken by the noise of a dog barking in one of the nearby rooms.				
3195264	50009259	After a period of time I rang reception to ask if the hotel had any dogs staying, I was told that 'Yes, we are a dog friendly hotel'.				
3195264	50009260	They said they would contact the owner.				
3195264	50009261	I then heard some noise outside and someone entered the room (after banging all the fire doors)going shhh.				
3195264	50009262	Reception rang me back to say that they had spoken to the owner of the dog and they thought it was the music from the bar that a was making the dog bark so the hotel had turned the music down in the bar.				
3195264	50009263	Some 10/15 minutes later I heard another dog barking but this didn't last long.				
3195264	50009264	I am a frequent traveller and if I had known this was a dog friendly hotel I would not have stayed or at least asked for a room away from the noise.				

3293269	50009270	Good value for money.		80009900	Dear Reviewer, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us.	
3293269	50009271	Tired decor but clean linens and friendly staff.		80009901	First of all I would like to thank you for your kind words regarding our team, beds and central location.	
3293269	50009272	---SEP---		80009902	Here at the Discovery Inn we are an older hotel but a hotel that is constantly thriving to improve with a team working hard behind the scenes making changes on a daily basis.	
3293269	50009273	Great vfm.		80009903	We are pleased overall you enjoyed your recent stay with us.	
3293269	50009274	Rooms very tired verging on scruffy decor.		80009904	Kind Regards David	
3293269	50009275	However beds very comfy.				
3293269	50009276	Quality clean linens and towels.				
3293269	50009277	Staff very friendly.				
3293269	50009278	Sadly during our stay there was a shocking smell of bins or drains around the hotel.				
3293269	50009279	Not sure if this was due to the recent heavy rain as it was also a bit smelly outside.				
3293269	50009280	Superb location right by the station, yet not especially noisy.				

3172087	50009290	Just a perfect downtown experience ---SEP---		80009915	Thank you for your sharing your experience from your recent stay with us.	
3172087	50009291	My wife took my two boys here to get away from the mountains for the night.		80009916	I was delighted to read your family had a great stay and hope you are able to come back with the family again this fall for a Bronco game or escape to the Mile High City.	
3172087	50009292	We had such a blast!		80009917	Traveling with children can certainly be an adventure and I was happy to hear you were comfortable in our rooms with two queen beds as they grow and everyone wants and needs more space you may want to consider one of our 47 suites.	
3172087	50009293	The GM here must be a great leader as the entire staff is service oriented and incredibly professional.				
3172087	50009294	The kids had their own area for checkin and even were given their own backpacks to keep throughout the stay.				
3172087	50009295	The room was ready early and was perfect for us.				
3172087	50009296	We had 2 Queen beds and it worked perfectly.				
3172087	50009297	One of the best things about this hotel is the location.				
3172087	50009298	We walked to the 16th street mall at night.				
3172087	50009299	We drove to the butterfly pavilion.				
3172087	50009300	All easily accessible.				
3172087	50009301	I love this place and can't wait to get back there with my two boys!				

3162914	50009310	Would stay again ---SEP---		80009928	Sam, thanks for your great review of our hotel.	
3162914	50009311	I stayed at Hotel Celebrity for 1 night as myself and a couple friends were attending a gig at the Bournemouth international centre (it was raining so we got a cab, it cost about ¬£6 and the hotel ordered it for us).		80009929	Our aim is to offer a good standard of accommodation from friendly staff at a very good affordable rate.	
3162914	50009312	We had the Kylie Minogue room, this hotel has personality and I'd certainly stay again.		80009930	Each of our bedrooms are themed on a different 'star' and we have loads of pictures of stars throughout the hotel - makes us somewhat different from the identikit hotel that our larger competitors offer.	
3162914	50009313	It does need updating quite considerably		80009931	thanks again for your very positive review.	
3162914	50009314	but it's a bit of fun.		80009932	Ken Robins, Owner	

3201393	50009320	Stay here, make a reservation!		80009943	Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.	
3201393	50009321	---SEP---		80009944	We are very fortunate to have wonderful management.	
3201393	50009322	If you are traveling on the Al-Can, and have made it to Dease Lake, you are aware that time and mileage are merely suggestions for the traveler.		80009945	Dede works hard to make our guests as comfortable as possible, frequently exceeding guests expectations.	
3201393	50009323	Road conditions are poor to fair.		80009946	Well done Dede!!!	
3201393	50009324	In summer, road construction is a fact of life.		80009947	Alison	
3201393	50009325	So when you arrive in Dease Lake, you feel as if you have stumbled upon an oasis.				
3201393	50009326	We arrived at the Northway Motor Inn shortly after 7 PM.				
3201393	50009327	Our family of 4 adults, 3 children, 2 dogs and two vehicles secured the last 2 rooms.				
3201393	50009328	The manager, Dede, asked if we had eaten, as the only place to eat in Dease Lake had closed at 7 PM.				
3201393	50009329	We had eaten prior to arrival, so it was not a problem for us.				
3201393	50009330	However, Dede does stock some frozen dinners for those who arrive late, and need to eat.				
3201393	50009331	Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean.				
3201393	50009332	Dede was welcoming, told us about the town, the history of the hotel, and when the cafe across the street would open.				
3201393	50009333	Parking was no problem, and if you are towing a boat, or trailer, you will have plenty of room.				
3201393	50009334	If you think you will be spending the night in Dease Lake, be sure to call ahead and make a reservation.				
3201393	50009335	This is a wonderful place, managed by wonderful people.				
3201393	50009336	Be sure to stay here.				

3257742	50009340	wonderful service throughout and very very clean ---SEP---		80009958	Dear Travelwithvivian, I‚Äôm so happy that you were pleased with your stay!	
3257742	50009341	The hotel is wonderful and super super clean, but what makes the real difference is the staff which excels itself.		80009959	I will pass on your comments to Dayana and Lillian.	
3257742	50009342	Starting with Diane at the reception with the nicest of welcomes and ending with Lillian from the breakfast buffet making sure continually I had everything I wanted.		80009960	It always makes their day to know they have positively impacted a guest‚Äôs stay.	
3257742	50009343	The rest of the personnel is included as well!!!!!		80009961	I hope we see you again soon!	
3257742	50009344	Everybody was attentive and serviced with a smile!!!		80009962	Silvana G.	

3301124	50009350	Family Holiday ---SEP---		80009973	Dear 661eamonnm Let me start by thanking you on my own behalf and on behalf of all the staff here at Parknasilla.	
3301124	50009351	We really enjoyed a nice relaxing stay.		80009974	It really is wonderful to read what a fantastic time you had with us here at the resort.	
3301124	50009352	Check in and out was done quickly.		80009975	I was delighted to read that you enjoyed every aspect of your stay especially the food offering and the takeaway option.	
3301124	50009353	The food was very nice although some didn't transit very well (Lamb Shanks for example)- as we ate in our lodge.		80009976	Thank you again for your kind review and I look forward to welcoming you back to Parknasilla at some stage in the future Warmest Regards Ruth O' Sullivan General Manager	
3301124	50009354	We would definitely come back in the next 3/4 years				

3202548	50009360	Breathtaking ---SEP--- Beautiful beautiful property.		80009987	Dear Emf18, First and foremost, thank you.	
3202548	50009361	Exquisite decor and friendly people.		80009988	Your glowing review is a testament of the passion The Palazzo has for our guests, and I am elated that you were able to experience the breathtaking beauty and comfort of our property.

3202548	50009363	The windows are floor to ceiling and the ceilings are high.		80009990	Kind Regards, Roi Ebalo Hotel Manager ‚Äì Guest Relations	
3202548	50009364	The bathroom is an entire room in itself and everything was very clean.				
3202548	50009365	Great location with easy access to the best shops and everything Vegas has to offer.				

3265935	50009370	Very good hotel ---SEP--- Good location and very clean.		80010001	Rosie 186220 Thank you so much for your lovely review.	
3265935	50009371	The staff were helpful, professional and courteous.		80010002	It is so encouraging for the team at the hotel when customers appreciate their efforts and then take the trouble to write a review.	
3265935	50009372	The restaurant food was of a very high standard.		80010003	Thank you from all the staff!	
3265935	50009373	Unfortunately though, as a single traveller, I got the room overlooking the fire escape, just a foot away from the window.		80010004	please come and see us again and keep recommending us to your friends and work colleagues.	
3265935	50009374	Other than that, a very pleasant stay.		80010005	Kind regards Michael Katzler Managing Director

3179704	50009381	Great location.		80010017	The Halekulani is my favorite hotel for a wedding - it must have been fabulous.

3179704	50009383	Walked to Moose McGillycuddy's for the Giants vs. 49ers and breakfast.		80010019	I'll pass along your generous comments to our staff!

3173204	50009390	Part of a very large group...		80010033	Dear MommaP2014, Thank you for taking your time to write a review regarding your recent stay with us.	
3173204	50009391	---SEP--- Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in early June.		80010034	I am pleased to see that overall you had a good stay with us The team	
3173204	50009392	Beds very comfortable with choice of pillows.		80010035	and I very much look forward to having the opportunity to welcome you back in the future Kind regards Kelly Louw Hotel Manager Kelly_louw@jurysinns.com	
3173204	50009393	Air con didn't work for duration of stay.				
3173204	50009394	Breakfast good but ran out of bagels who a couple of days.				
3173204	50009395	Evening meaks served in Oddsockd but are out a couple of nights				

3261556	50009400	disappointed ---SEP--- 1.		80010046	Thank you for the review of the Ramada Prince George Lisa S. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests.	
3261556	50009401	Three male employees stood at the desk and watched as we struggled with getting our baggage onto the trolley and into the hotel-		80010047	We are sorry to hear of the difficulties you had with your entering the hotel.	
3261556	50009402	no one helped.		80010048	If the agents at the desk were not currently busy assisting other guests, they should have offered to assist you.	
3261556	50009403	No one offered to assist us to our room.		80010049	If this is the case, we do sincerely apologize.	
3261556	50009404	2.		80010050	The magic glass in the room does take some getting used to.	
3261556	50009405	Our view out the window was of the alleyway- fine if the hotel were full but i don't think it was.		80010051	Some people quite like it while others do not find it as appealing.	
3261556	50009406	3.		80010052	The lighting in the bathrooms has been previously identified as an issue and we are currently going through all the renovated rooms and adding additional lighting to the bathrooms.	
3261556	50009407	There was a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom- this turned opaque when the bathroom door was closed tightly but we did not know this initially and thought we were going to have to watch each other do our business...		80010053	The lack of a mirror in the room is something that we are also currently working on improving.	
3261556	50009408	Also when the bathroom light was turned on, it lite up the entire bedroom which was not nice during the night.		80010054	We thank you for your comments Lisa S.	
3261556	50009409	4.		80010055	We do strive to make sure everyone's stay is an enjoyable one, and unfortunately, we seemed to have dropped the ball in your case.	
3261556	50009410	The lighting in the bathroom was awlful 5.		80010056	We will definitely use this as a learning opportunity.	
3261556	50009411	There was no mirror in the room (just in the bathroom)				

3195217	50009420	Very good ---SEP---		80010067	Thank you so much for choosing us as your host and gave us the opportunity to serve you.	
3195217	50009421	The people at the supper 8 in Vernon are the nices to deal with .they always make sure you are happy and comfortable .		80010068	i am delighted that you liked our place and our hospitable staff could make your stay enjoyable and comfortable.	
3195217				80010069	See you soon in near future.	

3326398	50009430	Best Hostel in Banff!		80010070	Wow!	
3326398	50009431	---SEP--- Stayed here for two nights and can't fault it!		80010071	Thanks for the great review Spohie - we love hearing your thoughts on the hostel.	
3326398	50009432	Everyone was super friendly from the get go, from front desk, to bar staff to housekeepers.		80010072	We're so glad you enjoyed the Beaver Bar and our comfortable rooms too!	
3326398	50009433	The beaver bar is a great place to grab a drink and meet people, locals and travellers alike making it the perfect place to base myself whilst in Banff.		80010073	Enjoy the rest of your travels.	
3326398	50009434	The bed was super comfortable too.				
3326398	50009435	Would definitely stay here again if I ever find myself in Banff :)				

3318083	50009440	Wow!		80010084	Thanks for joining us, and for your kind review.	
3318083	50009441	What a hotel!		80010085	We'd love to see you back soon.	
3318083	50009442	---SEP---		80010086	Kind regards, Peter Tennent PS Keep raving about us too, thanks.	
3318083	50009443	The Devon Hotel would be one of the best hotels I have stayed in.		80010087	Appreciated!	
3318083	50009444	Clean, modern, great staff, and nothing was too much trouble.				
3318083	50009445	We fell in love with the hotel and the town during our stay.				
3318083	50009446	The restaurant (a buffet restaurant) was one of many highlights.				
3318083	50009447	We will be back.				
3318083	50009448	We will be raving about this place for a long time.				

3321310	50009450	maybe when remodeling is done ---SEP---		80010098	We appreciate your feedback from your recent stay at our hotel and your loyalty as a Diamond member.	
3321310	50009451	I was a diamond member for many years and I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and this was the worst.		80010099	We are sorry that you were not happy during your stay.	
3321310	50009452	The wifi was awful, in fact non existent		80010100	Our staff does strive in great customer service and does their best to make everyone feel welcomed and comfortable.	
3321310	50009453	and they obviously are seriously renovating the place and so pool was closed.		80010101	We are currently under going renovations to spruce the place up a bit.	
3321310	50009454	(They should have closed place during reno)		80010102	We do have posted on our website about our renovations and we have signs posted by the front door and at the front desk to make all our guests aware of our renovations.	
3321310	50009455	We were there for two days prior to our cruise and there really wasn't a place to hangout.		80010103	Again we apologize for the inconvenience and hope you would reconsider giving us a second chance with our new changes happening.	
3321310	50009456	The breakfast area here was awful.		80010104	Thank you for choosing Hampton	
3321310	50009457	I thought by reading info that they had a shuttle to the Port of Tampa				
3321310	50009458	but then they told me it was $40.				
3321310	50009459	Fortunately I used points				
3321310	50009460	but I would definitely never recommend this Hampton.				
3321310	50009461	Go elsewhere.				

3284049	50009470	Nice clean modern hotel ---SEP---		80010115	Dear Gabrielle F, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay with us!

3284049	50009474	The only downside were the room lights.		80010119	Thanks again for staying with us and sharing your feedback!	
3284049	50009475	There was no way to independently turn on/off each individual light.		80010120	Regards, Erica Zerbe-	
3284049	50009476	This was just a minor inconvenience.		80010121	Hotel Manager

3321909	50009485	Beautiful sunrise.				
3321909	50009486	Check out the discounts given in the hotel book and take advantage of them.				
3321909	50009487	Free hot breakfast but limited hot items in my opinion .				

3246474	50009490	Great as usual ---SEP---		80010147	Dear Nikolina S, Thank you for your loyalty to the Meriton brand!	
3246474	50009491	I aways enjoy staying at any of the Meriton hotels as I know the quality to expect at every hotel.		80010148	We are excited to have 14 hotels in NSW and QLD and with more about to open the doors in the coming months!	
3246474	50009492	Fully equip hotel is great and beds are super comfy.		80010149	Its great to read that you have enjoyed all your experiences in the various Meriton hotels, the team and I look forward to being of continued service to you in the near future.

3234754	50009500	Superb (again!!)		80010161	Thank you very much for your review....	
3234754	50009501	---SEP---		80010162	it means a lot to us.	
3234754	50009502	This is our second visit to Exmoor House and once again we had a perfect stay.		80010163	As for the walking you'll already know there's lots of options.	
3234754	50009503	The owners offered us drinks and snacks early evening and the breakfast as usual was just brill!		80010164	We've just taken delivery of booklets re local walking routes...as you enjoy your walking we'll pop a few in the post over to you.	
3234754	50009504	We stayed in the same room which was spotless and really comfortable.		80010165	Once again thanks for your positive review.	
3234754	50009505	We‚Äôll be back bringing friends next time to do a bit more walking as the scenery across the hills is really something special.

3283654	50009520	Last minute change ---SEP---		80010191	Thank you so much Tracey for your 5 star review on Tripadvisor on your recent 2 night stay with us at Hotel Woodstock.	
3283654	50009521	We were able to book a 2 rooms the day before for 2 nights.		80010192	The Hotel gets excellent feedback on our super comfortable orthopaedic beds and the Egyptian cotton linen is a nice bonus we don‚Äôt have facecloths in the rooms as a standard but they are available upon requests.	
3283654	50009522	The hotel was perfect for what we wanted.		80010193	I am glad to see that you were impressed with the food on offer at breakfast and in the bar and restaurant.	
3283654	50009523	We are in bother the pub and the restaurant and the food was delicious.		80010194	Looking forward to welcoming you back to the Hotel again in the near future and the best rates are always available on the Hotels website as opposed to booking through a third-party site which charges up to 18% commission to the Hotel and don‚Äôt forget to sign up to our special offers on our website.	
3283654	50009524	Breakfast the first morning was not too busy as we were there about 8.		80010195	Kind Regards Elaine Lally Owner / Director	
3283654	50009525	The next morning we went about 930 and it was really busy.				
3283654	50009526	Good selection of hot, cold and fruit.				
3283654	50009527	Room was nice.				
3283654	50009528	Beds were comfortable with crisp white sheets.				
3283654	50009529	You need to ask for facecloths if you want them.				
3283654	50009530	It is a 5 minute drive to city center.				

3169192	50009540	Customer Service ---SEP--- Customer Service was outstanding as our reservations were not in their system, but with the help and support of Erin at the front desk we were able to get it resolved to beyond satisfaction and enjoy our stay.		80010206	We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us after your recent stay at the Atlantic Hotel and Spa!	
3169192	50009541	Great Hotel and staff.		80010207	While it saddens us to hear that you encountered some issues with your reservations, we are so glad that Erin and our team were able to make sure you were taken care of.	
3169192				80010208	It is wonderful to hear that you had a great experience with us.	
3169192				80010209	We hope to see you again next time you are in Fort Lauderdale.	

3211649	50009550	Excellent new hotel in the centre of Cardiff ---SEP---		80010210	Hello Gareth H, Thank you very much for leaving us a great 5* review!	
3211649	50009551	An excellent addition to Cardiff's portfolio of hotels.		80010211	I am glad you loved your Welsh themed room experience and hop you will look to stay with us many more times in the future.	
3211649	50009552	I hope the room rates continue to be as reasonable as they were when I stayed, and they don't start to creep up as some of the other Cardiff hotels have done.		80010212	We do actually have 3 lifts for our guests to use for room access which helps with access when our central lift gets busy.	
3211649	50009553	Excellent staff, very efficient, friendly and welcoming.		80010213	I will pass on the idea with soap dishes for you!	
3211649	50009554	Rooms are beautifully furnished and very well equipped - really comfortable beds, good bathrooms and showers, and plenty of power outlets (and USB charging ports) everywhere.		80010214	We always look for suggestions from our guest to help us improve our service.	
3211649	50009555	The only thing that's missing is soap dishes in the bathrooms - the small bars of soap have nowhere to rest, meaning they have to sit on the worktop next to the wash basin.		80010215	Until next time!	
3211649	50009556	The only downside of this hotel is something that can't be fixed, but should definitely have been thought of at the planning/design stage.		80010216	Kindest regards Jacques Duval Front of House Supervisor Hotel Indigo Cardiff	
3211649	50009557	There's only one lift, serving 100+ hotel rooms (potentially 200+ guests) and the restaurant on the top floor, including kitchen staff transporting food from basement storage to the kitchen (I shared a lift with a chef and a large box of mushrooms one evening!).				
3211649	50009558	This is nowhere near enough, and can result in some long waits for the lift to get up to the higher floors.				

3210968	50009560	renaissance marriott downtown ---SEP---		80010227	Our Floyd is what we call a Lobby Ambassador - he knows everything about, and everyone in, the downtown area!	
3210968	50009561	My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights - he attended a conference (great location for that) and I was on my own.		80010228	He's a true treasure!	
3210968	50009562	First impressions weren't great.		80010229	Sorry to hear about your experience at check in, that has been addressed and additional training is in the schedule.	
3210968	50009563	Receiptionist at booking wasn't friendly whatsoever - bad day or something and that set the tone.		80010230	Thank you very much for your feedback, and we hope to see you again!	
3210968	50009564	She was very distant.				
3210968	50009565	THEN there was Floyd - a porter.				
3210968	50009566	He made up for everything.				
3210968	50009567	Couldn't have had more personality.				
3210968	50009568	Room was satisfactory - nothing more.				
3210968	50009569	TV sucked - needed to have someone come in to fix it.				
3210968	50009570	Getting rooms cleaned was a big 'production' at times and always someone knocking and checking up on cleaning staff.				
3210968	50009571	Gym and pool were alright.				
3210968	50009572	We stayed on 5th floor so that was convenient.				
3210968	50009573	As well, they checked us in early without making a big issue - that was great, and let us stay 2 hours later - that was great as well.				
3210968	50009574	Very accomodating Best secret was restaurant - Steve's across the street - down one block.				
3210968	50009575	Awesome in every way.				
3210968	50009576	American cooking - relaxed. ..				
3210968	50009577	Sad part is - there is nothing going on downtown.				
3210968	50009578	Very little shopping to be had.				
3210968	50009579	Wednesdays (4 - 8 pm)				
3210968	50009580	Saturday mornings 8 - 12) there was a fun market.				
3210968	50009581	Enjoyed that.				
3210968	50009582	Lots of homeless meandering around				
3210968	50009583	so I didn't always feel safe.				
3210968	50009584	Merchants hired people in orange shirts (forget name) community hosts were everywhere to offer assistance in any way - info - a walk somewhere, etc.				
3210968	50009585	Great strategy.				
3210968	50009586	Some day the downtown will be totally wonderful again.				
3210968	50009587	For now - they are trying to make downtown come alive again.				

3265321	50009590	Perfect location for Husky Tri Festival ---SEP---		80010241	Hi Valued Guest, Thanks for your feedback!	
3265321	50009591	I did my first Huskisson Triathlon and wanted to stay close to the action.		80010242	Please mention this review for 10% off your next stay!	
3265321	50009592	I couldn't have gotten any closer!		80010243	Regards John	
3265321	50009593	Across the road from the transition and finish line!				
3265321	50009594	The management had sent a confirmation email a couple of days before we were due to arrive, which had a slight error in it, and they were happy to fix it straight away.				
3265321	50009595	The room was quite nice, it is a motel, so of course things are basic, but all clean, and the bed was very comfortable.				
3265321	50009596	There was a good selection of foxtel channels available (including all 3 Foxtel sports channels) along with the usual digital stations.				
3265321	50009597	After my race all I wanted was a decent shower, but I wasn't prepared for how good this was going to feel!!				
3265321	50009598	Like the Seinfeld episode...it was like a Russian shower head had been installed!!				
3265321	50009599	Exactly what I needed to get the aches and pains away...				
3265321	50009600	I wasnt the only one who thought so, as a couple of people commented on how good it was as well.				
3265321	50009601	Obviously, no low flow shower heads in this motel!!				
3265321	50009602	Overall, it was a pleasant stay, and the price was reasonable, especially considering every bit of accomodation gets booked out on this weekend in Huskisson and surrounding areas.				

3218137	50009610	Way 2 cold n no tv kids child wasnt happy no fridge so couldnt keep milk cold u get kettle n toaster no power point near ---SEP---		80010254	Apologies for your stay, cold is not in our control unfortunately, with Mt Schank having one of it's coldest recorded seasons, but the extra heaters in the room help.	
3218137	50009611	No review as it was horrible have to use shower to fill kettle real bad experience not a place to take kids wont be staying again left with a cold sik baby i was not a happy persin best thing was the court yard		80010255	As new owners we have now putting TV's in all the rooms & are dealing with the issues of power supply which has stalled the install of the fridges.	
3218137				80010256	We keep the room rate at $65 to compensate.	

3302487	50009620	An affordable indulgence ---SEP---		80010267	We appreciate your thoughtful comments - thankyou Nicholas.	
3302487	50009621	From the moment you enter the elegant hallway of this fine period property and are greeted by your hosts, Noel and Sharon we felt that we were guests, yes, obviously paying guests but somehow you forgot that while you are there.		80010268	Being well travelled you understand the adaption of a period house and the added modern conveniences, no ensuites and gas hot water heating in 1878!	
3302487	50009622	Our bedroom was not massive but then this is a adapted period property, not a motel.		80010269	We know how much guests enjoy the social interaction and camaraderie, meeting fellow travellers from other countries....	
3302487	50009623	A good view over the garden.		80010270	stories to share, tips to give and lots of laughter.	
3302487	50009624	We noted there is one room with a balcony which would be nice.		80010271	Best wishes	
3302487	50009625	"When traveling there we had popped into a local shop to ask for directions: as they were given the lady said she envied us as ""Sharon really looks after you "".How about that for a impromptu recommendation!"		80010272	Sharon & Noel	
3302487	50009626	A unusual aspect of your stay is the wine and canap√©s you may share with your fellow guests each evening.				
3302487	50009627	Your hosts are there as well and generally it is all very sociable.				
3302487	50009628	Breakfasts are as good as you would expect with a range of home made products.				
3302487	50009629	Now,there is a premium to pay for all this but it is fair value for a memorable experience.				
3302487	50009630	If you can book it,do so.				

3232838	50009640	Would stay here again ---SEP---		80010283	Thank you for your review!	
3232838	50009641	My partner and I stayed for 6 nights at the Vineyards Caravan park.		80010284	We are pleased you enjoyed your stay with us at Perth Vineyards Holiday Park and your time spent in Perth.	
3232838	50009642	As we were making our way to Perth we received a phone call from reception asking us were we still joining them at the caravan park.		80010285	We are investigating the GPS location issue and are endeavouring to rectify this issue as soon as possible.	
3232838	50009643	Nice gesture.		80010286	We hope to see you again.	
3232838	50009644	The address on car navigators isn't where the caravan park is and the caravan park recognises this error.		80010287	Aspen Parks Regional Managers, Perth Metro & South Australia	
3232838	50009645	The people in reception were really helpful and friendly.				
3232838	50009646	We had a large grassed powered site and the grounds were well maintained.				
3232838	50009647	The amenities block was nice and clean with plenty of room in the shower cubicles.				
3232838	50009648	It's relatively close (driving) to a major shopping centre and train station.				
3232838	50009649	Would stay there again!				
3232838	50009650	Thanks				

3179652	50009660	Visit to Shoal Bay ---SEP---		80010298	Dear Margaret, Thank you for sharing your feedback on your recent stay with us at Ramada Resort Shoal Bay Please accept my sincere apology that your room cleaning is not up to the standard we strive to achieve upon your arrival, I have addressed your concerns with our Housekeeping Department.	
3179652	50009661	On arrival at reception entrance had to wait in car queue.		80010299	I have also passed on your additional comments to each department so that we can provide further training and improve attention to detail in all areas.	
3179652	50009662	Entering into reception foyer accosted by sales staff offering something not interested.		80010300	Thank you again for your feedback	
3179652	50009663	Reception staff reasonable but had to organise your own luggage trolley, then unload your luggage from car and take up to your room then come back down and move your car to designated parking area.		80010301	and I hope that we are able to welcome you back again in the future Warm regards, Josie Gibson	
3179652	50009664	On entering room it smelt very strongly of garlic so opened a oby door to air.				
3179652	50009665	Dining table in room very unstable and close to collapsing.				
3179652	50009666	Had to get maintenance up to remove garlic smell.				
3179652	50009667	Apartment very well self contained with utensils, cutlery and china wear only for two people.				
3179652	50009668	Room was comfortable and close to eating places with great view over water.				

3260028	50009670	Good night's sleep with a huge BUT...		80010312	Dear hw-in-bermuda Thank you for taking the time to share your review and for being a return guest of ours.	
3260028	50009671	---SEP--- 1.		80010313	Your feedback is very much appreciated and it is wonderful to see that Jenny was able to make an impact during your stay with her friendly nature, she is a great ambassador and will be equally pleased to see that she has been personally recognised.	
3260028	50009672	Jenny on reception is excellent, I hope you check in with her.		80010314	As we are a luxury brand, this is reflected in our rates, we do however regularly compare with our competitors in the luxury hotel market and are found to be in line.	
3260028	50009673	2.		80010315	We do experience peak times of arrival and try our best to ensure that all staff members are assisting with waiting guests so we thank you for your patience during these times.	
3260028	50009674	The room was quiet, and the bed was fine, so a good nights sleep prior to an early flight.		80010316	Your observations are greatly appreciated and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a better experience in the future.	
3260028	50009675	3.		80010317	Kind Regards, Ryan Nicholls - General Manager Sofitel London Heathrow	
3260028	50009676	Very poor choice of food and beverage, particularly as this is an airport hotel, not a destination hotel.				
3260028	50009677	And it is solo expensive, we walked to the terminal and got stuff there.				
3260028	50009678	4.				
3260028	50009679	Check in was laboriously slow, waiting to get to the desk.				
3260028	50009680	There were four people working the desks but it took 25 mins to clear the 6 people in front of me.				
3260028	50009681	5.				
3260028	50009682	It is very expensive, and other than Jenny, the staff need 'politely interacting with people' lessons.				
3260028	50009683	There is a definite 'Parisienne pomp' to a London Airport hotel, with no coffee bar, but with a Salon du Th√©. 6.				
3260028	50009684	Breakfasts were really pricey, so we ate outside.				
3260028	50009685	Yes I have stayed here many times, as I live too far to drive and fly early mornings, but it all seemed so much hard work, not a good experience.				

3262727	50009690	Best hotel ever!!!!		80010328	Dear Globe Joceline P Thank you for choosing The New Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4.	
3262727	50009691	---SEP---		80010329	I am so pleased you enjoyed your stay and you loved the hotel.	
3262727	50009692	Your location Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4 Heathrow Airport, Terminal 4, Swindon Rd, Longford, Hounslow TW6 3FJ, United Kingdom Hotel Joceline Paczoski 2001 points 6 hours ago We booked the Crowne Plaza the night before our flight.		80010330	Again thank you for taking the time to write your review I really do appreciate it and I will share your feedback with the team personally.	
3262727	50009693	This is hands down the best hotel we have stayed at so far.		80010331	We all look forward to welcome you back when you are next in Heathrow.	
3262727	50009694	From check-in to check-out we were treated like royalty.		80010332	Warm Regards, Simon.	
3262727	50009695	The front desk employee was so kind and genuine.		80010333	General Manager.	
3262727	50009696	When she found out my birthday was the following day, she gave us free hot breakfasts.				
3262727	50009697	The suite was beyond our expectations.				
3262727	50009698	So big and well appointed.				
3262727	50009699	Robes, slippers, free mini bar, etc-				
3262727	50009700	Nothing was missed.				
3262727	50009701	To my surprise in the room waiting for we was a lovely box of fine chocolates with a heartfelt birthday note.				
3262727	50009702	What a lovely gesture!				
3262727	50009703	Our suite included access to the club lounge which was outstanding!!!				
3262727	50009704	Excellent views of the planes taking off and landing and lots of room to unwind and enjoy complementary hot and cold drinks.				
3262727	50009705	Then from 5-7pm it was Happy Hour with out of this world snacks, which were more like mini meals.				
3262727	50009706	They also had a nice variety of wines and other convivial beverages.				
3262727	50009707	Loved It!				
3262727	50009708	The bed was so comfortable, I forgot where I was.				
3262727	50009709	It was a treat to put on their thick robes and comfy slippers while getting ready in the morning.				
3262727	50009710	The breakfast buffet on Christmas morning was vast and beyond our expectations.				
3262727	50009711	We had never seen such a glorious spread like this one before.				
3262727	50009712	There was so much choice and everything was delicious.				
3262727	50009713	We each got our own coffee/tea pots which was a nice touch.				
3262727	50009714	There are not enough words to express how much we LOVED our stay at the Crowne Plaza London Heathrow Terminal 4 hotel.				
3262727	50009715	The employees are top notch and so helpful.				
3262727	50009716	Kudos to the entire T4 team!				
3262727	50009717	This hotel was an amazing start to our vacation and we can't wait to return!!!				
3262727	50009718	Thank you Crowne Plaza London Heathrow Terminal 4 for our magical stay!				

3210748	50009720	Overall a lovely stay.		80010344	Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at the Novotel Cardiff Centre.	
3210748	50009721	..just a shame some Staff really let it down ---SEP---		80010345	I am sorry that your experience did not meet your expectations; please allow me to express my sincerest apologies.	
3210748	50009722	We stayed here for one night with some friends.		80010346	At Novotel, we strive to provide a superior service experience for every customer; therefore your feedback is very important to us.	
3210748	50009723	We had only ever stayed in Novotel once		80010347	Please rest assured that whilst we acknowledge that the demand was unprecedented, we will be debriefing all the Team, taking the appropriate measures to address the service issue on this date related to the food allergy report and prevent future occurrence.	
3210748	50009724	but we were really looking forward to it.		80010348	We appreciate your sharing your concerns, and it is our hope that you will give us the opportunity to better serve you in the near future.	
3210748	50009725	Unfortunately we didn't have the best stay.		80010349	Douglas Goncalves	
3210748	50009726	My daughter has food allergies and as I know this can be difficult at meal times I let the reception know before we checked in.				
3210748	50009727	Their response was that they didn't have anything to do with it and to tell the restaurant in the morning.				
3210748	50009728	I thought this was strange but did as they said.				
3210748	50009729	The next morning I told the waiting staff about the food allergies and their responses were even more shocking.				
3210748	50009730	Although some members of staff were friendly, (the chef couldn't help us enough and really tried to make our experience a good one)others were simply rude, making us feel that we were a nuisance for having allergies and even refusing to check ingredients until being asked a few times.				
3210748	50009731	One particular staff member even muttered fussy under her breath and wewe're advised that some food was safe to eat and only when i asked them to double check did they find out it wasn't.				
3210748	50009732	We felt embarrassed, upset				
3210748	50009733	and we're made to feel a nuisance for something which we couldn't help and would make our daughter sick if we didn't address.				
3210748	50009734	We did inform reception about our issues and we met with the restaurant manager, (who was also lovely) but we feel that the situation really could have been handled better.				
3210748	50009735	There should be updated allergy menus available and better communication between reception and kitchen would have solved the issue entirely.				
3210748	50009736	They refunded half of our stay, but this really was little compensation for how they made us feel and the stress that we went through.				
3210748	50009737	We have never been treated like this before in any other hotel.				
3210748	50009738	It is such a shame because certain staff members were a credit to the company ( the chef would have gone out especially and purchased food we could eat had he been told when we arrived...which is obviously amazing) but the hotel really has been let down by the care given to its visitors on this occasion by some members of staff.

3233910	50009772	The hotel is an older hotel but the was perfect!		80010385	I appreciate the recommendation.

3196380	50009780	Great staff..		80010397	Dear lmac3826, Thank you for taking the time to write an extensive review about your experience at Mercure Melbourne Albert Park.	
3196380	50009781	Yuck rooms ---SEP--- Stayed 2 nights for a conference.		80010398	I sincerely appreciate you sharing your feedback about the various issues experienced during your stay and will be sure to address these accordingly with the team.	
3196380	50009782	Lobby looks amazing and I was looking forward to the room.		80010399	Your feedback helps us to improve.	
3196380	50009783	Very disappointed as the room was tiny, the king bed was two singles pushed together.		80010400	I do hope that you will choose to stay with us again in the future.	
3196380	50009784	Couldn't sleep in the middle of the bed as the gap was very uncomfortable.		80010401	Kind regards, Mr Llewellyn Wyeth General Manager	
3196380	50009785	No mini bar, white stains on the curtains, desk chair and bed cushions.				
3196380	50009786	Bathroom was tiny.				
3196380	50009787	No place to put shampoo and soap except on the shower floor.				
3196380	50009788	The shower was moldy probably because there was no exhaust fan...				
3196380	50009789	Even a short shower resulted in complete fogging up of the room.				
3196380	50009790	No hair dryer.				
3196380	50009791	View was a building wall.				
3196380	50009792	Traffic noise kept me awake until 1am and woke me up at 5 am.				
3196380	50009793	Ordered room service.				
3196380	50009794	Was told it would take 1 hour..it took 2.				
3196380	50009795	Didn't get dinner til past 10pm Would not stay here again due to the above mentioned issues.				
3196380	50009796	I have stayed at cheaper places in better locations in Melbourne and had much better rooms.				
3196380	50009797	Good things: Great staff.				
3196380	50009798	Every interaction was fantastic.				
3196380	50009799	Best staff I have ever encountered and this goes to the check in and check out staff, the cleaners and the food service people.				
3196380	50009800	This is the main reason I gave 3 and not 1 star.				
3196380	50009801	Food was very good.				
3196380	50009802	Loved the juice machine And fresh juices.				
3196380	50009803	Had breakfast buffet and lots of options...				
3196380	50009804	Esp for a vegetarian.				
3196380	50009805	Wait staff was amazing.				
3196380	50009806	Cleared tables quickly despite being very busy.				
3196380	50009807	All staff was great.				
3196380	50009808	Seriously most friendly staff...				
3196380	50009809	Management is doing a good job there.				
3196380	50009810	My main gripe is the state of the rooms.				

3189208	50009820	Great place to stay near Denver airport ---SEP--- Room was very comfortable and the front desk people very helpful with the shuttle to the airport.		80010412	Thank you for reviewing our hotel.	
3189208	50009821	We had a very early morning flight and the front desk made sure we had the right time on the shuttle.		80010413	Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback.	
3189208	50009822	Everything went smoothly.		80010414	By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future.

3287320	50009830	Great hotel ---SEP---		80010420	Hi Lily H, Thank you for sharing your review of your memorable stay with us in the heart of beautiful Waikiki.	
3287320	50009831	The staff itself deserves a 6 star rating.		80010421	We're so proud to read your compliments on the excellent service you received from the team.	
3287320	50009832	Everyone was kind, accommodating and helpful!		80010422	The team is excited to read that you would stay with us on future visits to the island and wish you all the best in your upcoming travels.	
3287320	50009833	This particular hotel has a very boutique look and vibe.		80010423	Mahalo!	
3287320	50009834	We loved staying here and would come here again.				
3287320	50009835	The pool is shallow so it's great for kids.				

3204684	50009840	Nice but needs to work out kinks ---SEP--- Nice and clean.		80010434	Venture43640, I sincerely apologize for the encounters you experienced upon check out.	
3204684	50009841	Very weird bathroom with clear doors to shower and water closet which is totally unnecessary and unsafe.		80010435	After reviewing your final bill, I see that the front desk compensated 50% back to your credit card due to the inconvenience.	
3204684	50009842	Restaurant staff are all great, competent and friendly.		80010436	If you would like to reach out to me personally at allyson.humphrey@thejacquard.com, I would be more than happy to speak further about the issue.	
3204684	50009843	Front desk staff are all rather inexperienced, perhaps as they ALL were so young.		80010437	However, it is so great to hear that you enjoyed Narrative Restaurant, they really do have an amazing staff!	
3204684	50009844	Screwed up our bill though we had three different people trying to settle it.		80010438	Please feel free to reach out to me at any time and we hope to be able to see you again soon!	
3204684	50009845	Just needed it separated personal and business charges and paid accordingly.		80010439	Warm Regards, Allyson Humphrey Guest Service Manager	
3204684	50009846	They double charged both credit cards.				
3204684	50009847	They need experienced staff here.				

3192661	50009850	If you want a dated room and employees that hate their jobs then this is the hotel for you!!		80010440	Hi Nannerbee, Thank you for your feedback.	
3192661	50009851	---SEP---		80010441	I apologize as it sounds like your room does not reflect the quality our hotel is known for.	
3192661	50009852	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and the room was in terrible condition.		80010442	I will be sure to share this with our team.	
3192661	50009853	The toilet seat was peeling, the sink and mirror were cracked, the shower was missing tiles and molded.		80010443	I hope you will give us another chance as I'm confident you will have a much better experience.	
3192661	50009854	Their were stains on the comforter and the AC did not work.		80010444	All the best, Kevin - GM

3237848	50009861	The best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff.		80010456	The location is the absolute best and the views are breathtaking, when the weather is nice, it would be a crime to stay indoors.	
3237848	50009862	Warm welcome, very detailed instructions regarding parking, extra fees.		80010457	There are lots of outdoor patios to enjoy a meal or beverage, all kinds of nifty retail outlets and the hiking trails are fantastic.	
3237848	50009863	Waive our interent fee for a day and gave us an underground park pass, thank goodness as it is a hike from the outdoor lot(s).		80010458	Thank you for recommending us to others.	
3237848	50009864	The onebed suite was clean, looked like it had never been used actually.		80010459	Yours in Hospitality, On behalf of Blue Mountain Resorts LP James Henry Vice President of Hospitality	
3237848	50009865	Everything you need is there, kitchen, small appliances etc.				
3237848	50009866	Nice balcony away from the Village side.				
3237848	50009867	Better deal than the Westin right next door.				
3237848	50009868	Yes its noisy during the day .				
3237848	50009869	Lots of kids, big deal, You are there to get outside, go ouside its beautiful.				
3237848	50009870	Outdoor pool at the hotel too.				
3237848	50009871	Lots of trails and activities.				
3237848	50009872	You walk out the front door and you are in the Village.				
3237848	50009873	Can't beat that.				
3237848	50009874	I reccommend for familiesand outdoor lovers.				

3165216	50009880	‚ÄúWifi isn‚Äôt everything!‚Äù		80010460	Dear nicholas1888, I am so pleased with your review of The Pearle of Cable Beach.	
3165216	50009881	---SEP---		80010461	The location of the resort lends itself to the sheer privacy, peace and quiet in or little pocket of Cable Beach.	
3165216	50009882	The Pearle is located somewhat off the beaten track on the Cable beach side of town.		80010462	We love that our villas are well equipped with all of the facilities that you need, as a self contained option.	
3165216	50009883	The upside is that you are within walking distance of the beach itself.		80010463	I hope to welcome you back to The Pearle, if you return to our unique and special town again!	
3165216	50009884	The rooms are spacious and well appointed.		80010464	Kind regards,	
3165216	50009885	Our unit had a large bbq and outdoor area.				
3165216	50009886	Everything is provided for self catering.				
3165216	50009887	The pool was warm and enjoyable.				
3165216	50009888	The wifi is marginal at best, but if you are spending your day at the beach who cares.				
3165216	50009889	If you are staying any length of time I would suggest you hire a car.				

3296449	50009890	Comfortable and convienent ---SEP---		80010475	Hi Heather Many thanks for your great review.	
3296449	50009891	Had two nights here, room clean, comfortable and had everything we needed.		80010476	We are delighted you enjoyed your stay.	
3296449	50009892	Very handy to town, only a 5 min walk and straight across from the beach.		80010477	Regards the team of the Anchorage	
3296449	50009893	Recommend an upstairs room as the noise of people walking around above you comes right through the floor and we didn't have noisy neighbours (thank goodness).				
3296449	50009894	Staff very friendly and helpful.				
3296449	50009895	Would not hesitate to stay here again.				

3204279	50009900	Don‚Äôt stay at the exchange hotel Vancouver if you want to sleep in a clean place ---SEP---		80010488	Hello jenlyn27, Thank you for providing us with your feedback regarding your recent stay with us.	
3204279	50009901	This hotel was horrible.		80010489	We are so sorry to hear about the negative experience you had, as this is not the service that we strive to provide our guests.	
3204279	50009902	The beds were crap, and worse than a roadside motel.		80010490	I invite you to reach out to me directly at gm@exchangehotelvan.com should you wish to discuss your concerns further, and we hope to welcome you back again.	
3204279	50009903	The room was dirty, floor, sheets and towels could all use a good wash.				
3204279	50009904	They didn‚Äôt have pillows, we had to call for them and it took forever.				
3204279	50009905	The only nice thing is they made a small dessert for my sisters birthday				
3204279	50009906	but they didn‚Äôt bring utensils and we had to call for those too.				
3204279	50009907	They are not on top of the customer experience.				
3204279	50009908	I don‚Äôt think they care at all about traveling guests or what they need.				
3204279	50009909	This spot was uncomfortable, dirty and overpriced.				
3204279	50009910	The location was fine, and I think that‚Äôs how they lure the innocent guests in				

3260741	50009920	Great location ---SEP---		80010501	Thank you for celebrating your birthday with us at the Crystal Lodge.	
3260741	50009921	My husband and I decided to travel with our small dog to Whistler for my birthday weekend; we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.		80010502	We are pleased that the experience exceeded all of your expectations and very much look forward to welcoming you back again in the future.	
3260741	50009922	The hotel has a great location right in the village, very dog friendly, clean rooms, and the staff are helpful.		80010503	Warm regards, Ian Lowe	
3260741	50009923	Underground parking, outdoor swimming pool, hot tub				

3196059	50009930	Never again ---SEP---		80010514	Hey Journey609334, Sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us.	
3196059	50009931	I booked a superior room with breakfast for ¬£145.		80010515	You can always check our website (www.marriott.co.uk) for all the information about us.	
3196059	50009932	It was no different from any of the hotels rooms.		80010516	I`m sorry if you felt disappointed about the room.	
3196059	50009933	When I questioned this I was told the difference was that I had tea and coffee making in the room.		80010517	Best, Aukse	
3196059	50009934	Breakfast was a shambles.				
3196059	50009935	Filthy tables not cleared or wiped.				
3196059	50009936	I had to clear a table for me use.				
3196059	50009937	The choice of hot food was an omelette and beens.				
3196059	50009938	I have stayed in hotels a lot with business.				
3196059	50009939	This was amongst the worst I have ever seen.				
3196059	50009940	Book a Premier Inn instead better quality and value				

3186714	50009950	Great place to overnight near YVR ---SEP---		80010528	We truly appreciate your decision to stay with us on your way to and your way back from Northern BC.	
3186714	50009951	I stayed at the Fairmont on my way through YVR to northern BC, and then again on the trip home.		80010529	I am thrilled to know that you loved your comfortable guest room, the fascinating views, your In Room Dining service, and my wonderful staff.	
3186714	50009952	It is a fabulous hotel - great for business travelers in transit.		80010530	We are very grateful for your compliments and look forward to our next chance to welcome you back to Fairmont Vancouver Airport!	
3186714	50009953	Rooms are bright, spacious and luxuriously-appointed and the beds are COMFY.		80010531	Warm regards, Patrick Gosselin General Manager	
3186714	50009954	On both nights, my rooms looked out onto the airport apron, which made for fun viewing.				
3186714	50009955	The great sound-proofing and blackout drapes nonetheless made for a good night's sleep.				
3186714	50009956	Hotel staff were very helpful and welcoming, and the room service breakfast was delivered quickly and still nice and hot.				

3317244	50009960	Convenient AND Friendly ---SEP---		80010542	Thank you so much for your lovely review!	
3317244	50009961	"Fast becoming a ""frequent stayer"" at this hotel - A 2 minute walk from the arrival level at the International airport front doors gets you to Rydges - not quite undercover all the way from the International Terminal, the last 100m is exposed to the elements."		80010543	Hope to see you again soon.	
3317244	50009962	I find it easy to access due to train service (both domestic and International terminals have train access) and easy to use transfers between the terminals is only a minutes walk from the front of the hotel.		80010544	- Boram Kim | Hotel Manager	
3317244	50009963	"Staff are always friendly and rooms are ""as advertised"" - I've never had cause to complain about the cleanliness of rooms or the facilities provided."				
3317244	50009964	The restaurant caters for early morning travellers with breakfast starting at 4am!

3298251	50009991	I stayed for 4 nights and really enjoyed our visit.		80010584	The Winterset is very special, and we are pleased that you appreciate the older style and mature foliage.	
3298251	50009992	We walked to the beach everyday and it was minutes from the airport as well as local shops and restaurants!		80010585	In fact, we have an Old Man Palm Tree, which is a very rare palm that is found mostly in collector's gardens.	
3298251	50009993	Loved the mature Floridian foliage, the three well-maintained pools and the staff were very friendly.		80010586	We have worked hard to preserve the native plants and mid-century modern architecture that is Winterset, and we are so happy that you noticed!	
3298251	50009994	The hotel also included umbrellas and chairs for the beach.		80010587	Take care, NBV	
3298251	50009995	Older style of hotel but did well in updating the rooms and they were very clean.

3211306	50010011	I was hesitant to stay at Baymont when I started reading the reviews online, but I ended up booking my stay because it was last minute and many other places weren‚Äôt available.		80010613	We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed our accommodations and thrilled that we were able to exceed your expectations.	
3211306	50010012	I was pretty shaken up from what I had read but upon arrival, I was greeted very politely by the front desk and noticed how clean the lobby was.		80010614	Guest's experience and satisfaction is our priority and your review reaffirms the hard work we put in remodeling our Hotel.

3300771	50010113	Beautiful food in the downstairs restaurant and breakfast had a great choice.		80010746	I do hope that we may have the chance of welcoming you back to Farnham Estate soon again.	
3300771	50010114	Grounds of the hotel have loads to see and do with great views over the lakes and brilliant walking trails.		80010747	Kind regards Bridie McManus Guest Relations	
3300771	50010115	The only negative was the king bed had two single mattresses pushed together, which a few hotels seem to be doing.				
3300771	50010116	This is something I really dislike and the pillows were way too soft and flat, so did not get a good nights sleep here.				
3300771	50010117	Apart from that though everything else was fabulous.				
3300771	50010118	Will definitely come back for another visit and will strongly recommend to family and friends.				
3300771	50010119	Without doubt this is the best hotel in Cavan.

3300817	50010132	I am on a business trip for more than week in London and I stayed again in this modern hotel at the Shard.		80010773	It is our pleasure to help you during your stay.	
3300817	50010133	I thought mentioned that I need to buy a lot of milk powders for my kids and do not have time to do so, and they offered to help to buy 16 boxes of milk.		80010774	We look forward to welcoming you back soon!	
3300817	50010134	They sent a young staff called Victor and visited the supermarket eight times to get all 16 boxes!		80010775	Kind regards, Paul Brackley, General Manager	
3300817	50010135	It is because the rules restricted each time, each person can only buy 2 boxes.				
3300817	50010136	Therefore he must be tired!				
3300817	50010137	What is more their staff helped me to do all the packings because I told them I do not have to pack all so many things due to meetings until the last minutes to airport.				
3300817	50010138	The best services you can find in London!				

3295022	50010140	Great hospitality ---SEP---		80010786	Hello GeoAnger, Thank you for your kind words, it was a true pleasure to have your group with us!	
3295022	50010141	Our group (Gentlemen of Harmony) of over 20 stayed here, the April weekend of the ice storm.		80010787	We strive to create a 'home away from home' atmosphere for all of our guests.	
3295022	50010142	We were forced to stay an extra night.		80010788	Hearing your singing and laughter really helped bring the hotel to life during the storm - truly turning lemons into lemonade.	
3295022	50010143	They opened their breakfast room for us.		80010789	We look forward to seeing you all again soon!	
3295022	50010144	Huge thank you for that.

3231515	50010153	Brandon and Charlie were very helpful with our check in.		80010793	In the Spirit of Hospitality, Taylor McInerney Assistant General Manager	
3231515	50010154	All the staff were very friendly and nice.				
3231515	50010155	The suite was clean and the bed was comfortable.				
3231515	50010156	The bathroom lacked towel bars and grab handles.				
3231515	50010157	The room arrangement lacked.				
3231515	50010158	The sofa was under the television.				
3231515	50010159	We had to lay on the bed to watch television.				
3231515	50010160	There was no place to put our luggage so we used the other bed.				
3231515	50010161	We had a suite with two queen beds.				
3231515	50010162	We didn‚Äôt try the restaurant except for our free drink.				
3231515	50010163	The hotel is conveniently located.				
3231515	50010164	We walked everywhere or rode the streetcar.				
3231515	50010165	The parking fees were very expensive.				
3231515	50010166	Otherwise we had a really good visit.				
3231515	50010167	We were impressed with the people and the service all over the city.				
3231515	50010168	Everyone was friendly and courteous.				
3231515	50010169	We will be visiting again someday.				

3213484	50010170	Review ---SEP--- Fantastic ocean view, magnificent location.		80010804	Dear Dream16458207579, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us.

3307199	50010183	The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is because I couldn't change the auto-dimming feature on the tv which annoyed me while the tv was on.				
3307199	50010184	We would stay here again without question.				

3172806	50010190	Great pub with fantastic accommodation ---SEP---		80010832	Hi Brett021, Thank you so much for your fantastic review, we truly appreciate it.

3246232	50010200	Wonderful sevice ---SEP---		80010847	Hello, Your praise regarding our dining experiences, amenities, and outstanding hospitality are all deeply appreciated!	
3246232	50010201	We went to the 6th floor restaurant for breakfast most days during our stay.		80010848	Thank you for choosing our beachfront resort and we hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future.	
3246232	50010202	The service from the host to the waitress petrone and the chef Coyhen were all so wonderful.		80010849	Sincerely, Kathryn Day General Manager	
3246232	50010203	I would definitely come back!				
3246232	50010204	The rooms were okay, the pool is nice and the service at the front desk is wonderful too.				

3297065	50010210	Weekend break ---SEP--- Stayed here 10th -12th		80010850	Dear MaryB, At the Clayton Hotel Cardiff Lane we always welcome our guest‚Äôs feedback positive or negative, as we believe this is the most important tool we have to improve our services.	
3297065	50010211	March.		80010851	Many thanks for sharing your experience in our hotel and raising your concerns.	
3297065	50010212	Hotel is well situated a short walk from the city centre or a 10 minute cab ride.		80010852	If you would like to discuss them in more detail please feel free to contact me at guestrelations.cardifflane@claytonhotels.com.	
3297065	50010213	Room was ok, clean with a comfortable bed and nice linen.		80010853	I am very happy that our bedroom‚Äôs cleanliness met with your satisfaction along with our comfortable beds and that our staff were very helpful and friendly which really is one of the most important things that we aim for when people come to stay with us.	
3297065	50010214	Tea and coffee facilities although not enough milk for any more than two cups of tea.		80010854	You can be sure that we will address your feedback at our weekly management meeting and discuss the points you kindly shared.	
3297065	50010215	Only downside was no air conditioning, not a problem in March but maybe would be in summer.		80010855	We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to our hotel in the near future, Kind Regards, Conor O‚ÄôKane General Manager	
3297065	50010216	Room had sliding door onto small balcony which was useful but the balconies are separated by cloth partitions which rattle all the time so sleeping with the door open would be difficult.				
3297065	50010217	Used the gym, didn‚Äôt use the pool on Sunday - full of children, swimming lessons and ‚Äú family time‚Äù so gave it a miss.				
3297065	50010218	A decent hotel for a short stay, staff very helpful and friendly.				

3314119	50010220	Great stay ---SEP---		80010866	Dear dajoubran Thank you for taking the time to review our property.	
3314119	50010221	Location was perfect and staff was very friendly and accommodating.		80010867	I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3314119	50010222	Services we used were good and value was there for the property.				
3314119	50010223	Tour bus parking made entry and exit a bit testing at times but otherwise easy in and out.				

3269122	50010230	Good stay for the night.		80010878	Dear Guest, Many thanks for your recent review and valued feedback.	
3269122	50010231	---SEP---		80010879	We appreciate your custom and look forward to welcoming you back to see us in the future, Kind regards Ciaran O Donovan	
3269122	50010232	My wife and I stayed here for one night, since we had to fly out early from Dublin the next morning.				
3269122	50010233	The shuttle to and from the airport is free and the remodeled restaurant is AMAZING.				
3269122	50010234	The hotel itself is dated, but the beds were clean and comfy, and the bathrooms were clean and updated.				
3269122	50010235	TV didn't work, but we didn't care.				
3269122	50010236	But, our first room had an awful smell.				
3269122	50010237	We did ask to the have our room changed and we were taken care of immediately!				
3269122	50010238	The only complaint I had was with the wifi.				
3269122	50010239	We had little to no wifi reception and the hallways did smell a little funny (but the rooms did not).				

3251375	50010240	Quirky ---SEP--- Lovely little hotel with a quirky layout.		80010880	Hello penrhynbayred, Thank you for your review of your stay at Chateau Rhianfa.	
3251375	50010241	Staff very helpful and really recommend it.		80010881	We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3251375	50010242	Stayed in a lodge room which is nicely appointed.		80010882	I hope we can welcome you back another time.	
3251375	50010243	Only criticism is the plumbing - when taps are turned on or toilets in nearby rooms flushed it is noticeable		80010883	Kind regards, Claire Harvey-Smith Reception Manager	

3176779	50010250	Great management ---SEP---		80010894	Thank you for posting a review and for the kind works.	
3176779	50010251	Due to unforseen circumstance the waterslides wont be working this weekend.		80010895	Wade is exceptional and always puts the customer first, when the slide went down on Thursday evening thinking as a parent and his children, not wanting to disappoint any families he called all reservations that had children listed so they could have the option of booking else where.	
3176779	50010252	The manager Wade was good enough to phone and let us no before we came up which I think shows great respect for his customers and for his front desk employees managing customers.		80010896	The slide has been repaired but not before disappointing our guests for which we are truly sorry.	
3176779	50010253	I am disappointed about the waterslide being down		80010897	I work with exceptional people and we truly do care about our guests.	
3176779	50010254	but I am looking forward to our weekend and if the rest of the staff is as diligent in there job as him we will enjoy our stay!!		80010898	We do hope you managed to enjoy some family fun still in the pool.	
3176779	50010255	J Hulak		80010899	Travel safe.	
3176779				80010900	Patty	

3166776	50010260	A fantastic stay ---SEP--- Very reasonable and pleased the free city tram service was so close.		80010911	Thank you for a perfect score, we are glad that hear that we were able to meet your expectations, we look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3166776	50010261	I utilised this each day.		80010912	Kind Regards, Martin Wilson	
3166776	50010262	Buses were nearby, Adelaide trainnsuited my needs the best.				
3166776	50010263	It was mostly very quiet and it was great seeing a security person within the complex on Saturday night				

3274892	50010270	Time outand relaxation ---SEP---		80010923	Hello, Thank you for taking the time to review Mantra Lorne.	
3274892	50010271	Great place, good food and awesome service.		80010924	Your feedback has been correlated and will assist us in targeting areas for improvement, so thank you for sharing your experience.	
3274892	50010272	We went for a lovely weekend and were treated personally by the GM.		80010925	Cheers Abraham	
3274892	50010273	Great start...				
3274892	50010274	Lovely room very modern, great amenities, position within Lorne etc.				
3274892	50010275	Great meal, and breakfast the following day Really enjoyed it.				

3298245	50010280	Excellent ---SEP--- Excellent room, with attention to details that give it a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere.		80010936	Dear Guest, Thank you for your kind review, I am pleased you enjoyed your stay.	
3298245	50010281	I had the back room on the ground floor, which was very quiet.		80010937	great to meet you.	
3298245	50010282	Spotted a squirrel in the garden one morning.		80010938	Best wishes Rosa.	
3298245	50010283	Greeted a goose one evening :)				
3298245	50010284	Good English breakfast, with a suprising fruity creation to start with, on both mornings.				

3213739	50010290	Nice Property ---SEP---		80010949	Dear Robert R, I am very pleased that you enjoyed your stay here with us.	
3213739	50010291	We had a nice 7-day stay at this hotel...spotlessly clean, up-to-date, friendly staff.		80010950	Thank you for all of your feedback, I will inform the kitchen about this.	
3213739	50010292	Will stay here again.		80010951	Besides that, I am very glad that everything was great for you!	
3213739	50010293	Our only disappointment was the breakfast spread (at 45 minutes yet to run, the assortment was very picked over and limited).		80010952	We do hope to welcome you back again soon.	
3213739	50010294	Ate the next day in the companion restaurant for the Garden Inn half of the building, and it was wonderful (made to order, great staff, etc.).		80010953	Thank you again.	
3213739				80010954	Best Regards, Lauren Brixey Sales Manager	

3200619	50010300	Disappointing wedding accommodation ---SEP---		80010965	It is only through honest feedback, both positive and negative, that we can improve our property and the services we offer.	
3200619	50010301	I am very disappointed with the experience of the accomodation at the sage, as I was staying there for a wedding.		80010966	Our functions floor offers many great spaces for anyone to utilise for special events, meetings or just simply catching up with friends.	
3200619	50010302	"We were given a ""special rate"" as we were guest at the wedding that was being held at the sage."		80010967	We are in the process of a soft refurbishment throughout the property including mattresses, rooms, painting, carpets and much more.	
3200619	50010303	It turns out I could have booked it cheaper or the same price, if I had booked online.		80010968	We hope you will return to experience the new look Sage Wollongong in the future.	
3200619	50010304	None of the wedding guests rooms weren't situated near each other.				
3200619	50010305	For the price we paid for the room, we then had to pay for parking extra.				
3200619	50010306	The sleep quality was average as the pillows were lumpy and gave no support.				
3200619	50010307	On the other hand the wedding facilitates were great.				

3218552	50010310	Really Good WeeK		80010979	I am pleased you are able to enjoy all that a Homewood Suites has to offer on your trips to visit your daughter.	
3218552	50010311	Long Stay ---SEP---		80010980	I am also pleased to announce that we will begin our Project Take Flight this summer and will receive a complete remodel!	
3218552	50010312	My wife and I come to Phoenix twice a year to visit my daughter who is living in the area.		80010981	I hope we will see you on a future trip to the Valley of the Sun!	
3218552	50010313	After reading some of the reviews here, I almost switched back to the Hampton Inn Baltimore we usually stay when in Phoenix, it's right down the street.				
3218552	50010314	I'm glad I didn't!				
3218552	50010315	"This is our new ""go to"" hotel when in Phoenix."				
3218552	50010316	Not sure if others reviewed the same place I stayed at.				
3218552	50010317	The rooms were very clean, the staff was great, and the food was what is to be expected with an inclusive deal.				
3218552	50010318	It was nice to have real dishes and silverware (as opposed to plastic plates and utensils at the Hampton Inn).				
3218552	50010319	There was a good variety in the morning, and plenty of room in the shared dining room.				
3218552	50010320	Our room was large and clean, a very good value as there was so much space.				
3218552	50010321	Other reviewers seem to think this place is out of date, and maybe I'm not up with the latest furnishings but it seemed fine to me.				
3218552	50010322	The room consisted of kitchen, dining area, living area, bedroom, bath and an area with a sink between the bath and bedroom.				
3218552	50010323	We had a flat screen TV in the bedroom and living area.				
3218552	50010324	The kitchen had black appliances (fridge and stove top, no oven) and stainless steel sink mounted on top of the granite counter tops.				
3218552	50010325	Maybe it was the way the sink was done that gave others the feeling it was dated.				
3218552	50010326	If you want to do some grilling while you are there, there are two gas grills out by the pool that guests can use.				
3218552	50010327	Fry's and whole Foods is right across the street.				
3218552	50010328	This came in handy as my daughter had a late day at school during our stay, and wanted a steak dinner when she got out.				

3294349	50010330	Another great stay ---SEP---		80010992	Dear TamB76, Thank you very much for posting a review following your stay at Pan Pacific Melbourne.	
3294349	50010331	Always the perfect choice when attending anything at the convention or exhibition centre.		80010993	I was delighted to note from your ratings that you enjoyed the room and your overall stay.	
3294349	50010332	Second stay for these reasons and both with kids 12 and 14.		80010994	I greatly appreciate your positive feedback on our decor, staff and location!	
3294349	50010333	Direct access to the convention centre through a 1st floor door, you don‚Äôt even have to walk outside which is great at night with kids.		80010995	We are indeed superbly located and I am very pleased you find it extremely convenient.	
3294349	50010334	Although the south Wharf precinct is great and I feel completely safe walking there at night as it is very family oriented.		80010996	Thank you once again for your time and we all hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Pan Pacific Melbourne in the not too distant future.	
3294349	50010335	Absolutely love the comfy beds and decor and rooms are always cleaned to perfection.		80010997	Sincerely, Craig Bonnor General Manager Pan Pacific Melbourne	
3294349	50010336	Great views and staff make this hotel a great choice.				

3228999	50010340	Five stars all round ---SEP--- I'd narrowed my search for a Sydney hotel down to around a dozen, but I chose this one mainly because of the reviews on here.		80011008	Dear Kris M, Thank you for staying with us and providing your feedback.	
3228999	50010341	I rely on these heavily when choosing a hotel for the first time (as I tend to stick to the same place when revisiting) so I will review this in my usual style.		80011009	I appreciate your kind comments regarding the service received and your special mention of Jade.	
3228999	50010342	Booking went well.		80011010	I look forward to your return to Sydney, kindly contact me on Arpad.romandy@sydney.amorahotels.com	
3228999	50010343	I was slightly concerned I hadn't been charged, but a simple email explained that charges aren't processed until you arrive, so that put that worry to bed.		80011011	and I will be able to assist you with your booking and perhaps have an opportunity to run through some of the comments you made in person.	
3228999	50010344	I decided to get a taxi to the hotel from the airport.		80011012	One comment I do wish to address, is your comment regarding the renovation and the pricing of the rooms.	
3228999	50010345	I've no doubt other options are available		80011013	As we have over 15 different rooms types, charging more for the renovated rooms would have resulted in a further 15 room types, as otherwise there would be no way to guarantee that you would receive the room type you had booked.	
3228999	50010346	but I always prefer the easiest option after a long flight.		80011014	This would have been extremely confusing for our guests.	
3228999	50010347	It cost $56 which I thought was a little steep, but there again it is a long journey and based upon other taxi journeys I made, that price seems fair and not a taxi driver trying to rip off a tourist at the airport.		80011015	We are excited about the renovation and we encourage our staff to talk about it and obtain feedback from our guests.	
3228999	50010348	I would imagine bus or train options would be easy, as Wynyard Station is five minutes from the hotel, but I won't dwell further as I didn't use this.		80011016	As an update on progress (using this as an opportunity for a plug) we have as of today renovated levels 4-16, levels 17-21 are currently being renovated and levels 22-34 are eagerly awaiting their turn.	
3228999	50010349	Check in was impressive.		80011017	The renovation is due to be completed by January 2015.	
3228999	50010350	Although I had informed them I would be arriving around 10am, I didn't expect the room to be ready.		80011018	We look forward to welcoming you back soon.	
3228999	50010351	But it was!		80011019	Kind regards, Arpad Romandy General Manager	
3228999	50010352	A nice and unexpected surprise after a long flight.				
3228999	50010353	I did have concerns I would get one of the older, and not refurbished rooms, however the gentlemen at reception informed me I had a fully refurbished one.				
3228999	50010354	That is something that worries me about this hotel.				
3228999	50010355	They seem to make a point of informing you that your room is virtually new, as was commented to me a few times.				
3228999	50010356	That makes me think that not many of the rooms in the hotel have been completed.				
3228999	50010357	That, combined with the manager on here consistently writing that they are in the middle of an upgrade (which I think sounds like an excuse for the room not being to standard) is a worry but this is not something which affected me.				
3228999	50010358	Having said that, I think it would be a valid complaint to say you weren't happy with the quality of the room citing the fact that you are paying the same as someone who has got one of these.				
3228999	50010359	However, like I said this did not apply to me.				
3228999	50010360	I had a corner room on level 7 (room 17) and it was fantastic!				
3228999	50010361	I have stayed in suites which have been smaller than this room.				
3228999	50010362	It had four large windows which let in plenty of light but had blinds and curtains to restrict this if and when needed.				
3228999	50010363	I'll make it clear now that I choose hotels based upon their location to where I want to be, and also the service.				
3228999	50010364	I doubt unless you choose a club room (and thus pay through the nose) you will get a view from your room.				
3228999	50010365	Mine looked out onto the road, a small park and a number of tower blocks.				
3228999	50010366	That didn't bother me in the slightest, as I go on holiday to see and visit places, not sit in my hotel room looking out of the window, but be aware of this.				
3228999	50010367	So, the room itself.				
3228999	50010368	Bathroom was a separate room which had both a bath and a really powerful shower with a number of settings.				
3228999	50010369	I was slightly put off by the massive plain glass window adjacent to the bath (bearing in mind it faces an office block) although you can drop the blind for a bit of privacy.				
3228999	50010370	Personally I would of expected privacy/tinted glass but that's not the end of the world.				
3228999	50010371	The bed is huge, comes with a variety of pillows and also has a seating area which was nice.				
3228999	50010372	I didn't really use the TV				
3228999	50010373	but it is a Smart one with extra content available at a premium.				
3228999	50010374	The mini bar was quite impressive.				
3228999	50010375	A variety of spirits in one drawer, a fridge with beers/wine and soft drinks and also some snacks.				
3228999	50010376	I didn't find the prices of these too bad, around $5 for a lemonade and the spirits were around $12.				
3228999	50010377	Restocked daily along with complimentary tea and coffee.				
3228999	50010378	The safe felt a bit cheap to me, but it's plenty big enough for a laptop and is fixed in the cabinet so it more than serves the purpose.				
3228999	50010379	All the units are self closing which is a nice touch as they don't seem anything spectacular to look at.				
3228999	50010380	I do agree with what some people have said that it seems like different parts of the hotel have been renovated at different times.				
3228999	50010381	The main thing I noticed was the doors.				
3228999	50010382	I'd say its a banker they are originals from when the hotel opened.				
3228999	50010383	It doesn't really make any difference but first impressions count and they do look old and worn.				
3228999	50010384	I also haven't stayed in any hotel (five star or not) recently which still uses the cards on the door handle for privacy or housekeeping.				
3228999	50010385	The doors were also my biggest irritation as the guests loved slamming them in the early hours.				
3228999	50010386	I would recommend the hotel look into this if and when they change them, as being constantly woken from 5am would be the only thing that makes me consider whether i do want to return.				
3228999	50010387	So that's the room done.				
3228999	50010388	I didn't use the business facilities so I will skip that.				
3228999	50010389	The pool and spa was what interested me				
3228999	50010390	but I was a little bit disappointed.				
3228999	50010391	The gym, whilst still having enough enough equipment for what I needed, is quite outdated.				
3228999	50010392	Considering the investment the hotel has made in other areas the gym stands out like a sore thumb, and I do hope they replace and update the equipment before I return.				
3228999	50010393	The pool itself is really nice and the lighting has a nice effect, especially at night.				
3228999	50010394	The jacuzzi and sauna/steam room facilities are also what you would expect.				
3228999	50010395	Seating around the pool I found quite strange.				
3228999	50010396	There are some sun beds but then also a couple of 'sofa type' things which I think look massively out of place and not something I would expect in a five star hotel.				
3228999	50010397	The Amora Spa is possibly the only part of my experience that I thought was typical of a five star hotel.				
3228999	50010398	I didn't use it so I can't comment on the service, but I thought the prices were vastly inflated.				
3228999	50010399	Maybe it's standard Sydney prices, I'm not sure, but near on $200 for an hour massage was not something I was prepared to pay.				
3228999	50010400	Disappointing, as it did seem underused while I was there				
3228999	50010401	and I would of used it if these prices were reduced.				
3228999	50010402	The bar and other seating areas were nice and modern, again with good prices which were short of what I would expect in a five star hotel.				
3228999	50010403	I didn't use the room service option so I will skip this but there seemed to be a good variety available at all hours.				
3228999	50010404	There are two restaurants available, opposite each other on the same floor.				
3228999	50010405	I'm surprised they don't market their Spanish one more (I walked past it twice on my way to the Gallery not even realising it was open.				
3228999	50010406	Normally I avoid hotel restaurants because the prices are high and part of the fun of being on holiday is exploring what options are available in your area.				
3228999	50010407	However I used the Gallery on my first night mostly out of convenience and I was hugely impressed.				
3228999	50010408	The menu is varied and the prices are incredibly low.				
3228999	50010409	They haven't compromised on service, that is true five star, but you don't feel that you are paying for it.				
3228999	50010410	Jade was especially nice, as was another lady I unfortunately didn't catch the name of, but considering how many people they must see during the course of a day I found it touching that she could remember serving me a week previously.				
3228999	50010411	It was the restaurant area that I also experienced something that I can only describe as bizarre.				
3228999	50010412	I was aware that on a Saturday they offered a seafood buffet, which didn't interest me as I'd already eaten tons of the stuff.				
3228999	50010413	Not realising the Gallery only offers this, I went there to see something that wouldn't be out of place in Butlins here in the UK.				
3228999	50010414	For those who don't know what that is, my view upon entering the restaurant was a Michael Buble/Elton John tribute act performing in front of some heavily intoxicated middle aged woman, who I felt were embarrassing themselves by how they were behaving.				
3228999	50010415	I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a top hotel.				
3228999	50010416	I chose to divert to the Charr restaurant, which turned out to be a blessing.				
3228999	50010417	The food was excellent, yet with very reasonable prices.				
3228999	50010418	I did think it was a bit tacky that you walk in to a glassed entrance with cans of olives, salami and other various food and drink items seemingly on display.				
3228999	50010419	I don't quite get what they are trying to do there.				
3228999	50010420	Overall I thoroughly recommend you visit their restaurants.				
3228999	50010421	One of the most enjoyable parts of this hotel was how relaxed it was.				
3228999	50010422	I've been in hotels before where I feel I'm being judged just because I'm not wearing a suit.				
3228999	50010423	In the Amora I thought nothing of walking through the doors at 7am caked in sweat and wearing some well used running gear.				
3228999	50010424	When i visited the Sheraton (which was also one of my options) to see a friend I thought I was going to be challenged by the concierge because of the way they looked at me.				
3228999	50010425	Be aware that some of the better named hotels in Sydney (like the Sheraton, along with the Four Seasons and others) really don't look anything special and the rooms are very poor.				
3228999	50010426	These will easily command $200 a night more.				
3228999	50010427	Disregarding the views you might have from your room, the location could not be better.				
3228999	50010428	Exit the hotel and turn left, walking straight for around three minutes and you will arrive at Darling Harbour.				
3228999	50010429	Exit and walk dead ahead and in five minutes you will be at Circular Quay.				
3228999	50010430	Finally turning right will take you into the shopping district and to the train and bus station.				
3228999	50010431	Nothing is more than five minutes away.				
3228999	50010432	There's also a shopping mall thirty seconds away which houses a number of places to eat and drink along with a Woolworths on the ground floor.				
3228999	50010433	I decided to venture further and walked to Centennial Park.				
3228999	50010434	It took under half an hour which included stopping at a coffee shop.				
3228999	50010435	If you look at how far it seems the hotel and the park are from each other, with the knowledge of how long it took me to get there, and suddenly this hotel could not be in a better place.				
3228999	50010436	Yes you could be right in the harbour or the quay				
3228999	50010437	but then everything else is further away.				
3228999	50010438	Finally, check out was a breeze and the concierge soon hailed me a taxi from the rank across the road.				
3228999	50010439	I was only too happy with my stay and definitely feel like I chose the best hotel in Sydney.				
3228999	50010440	If you want five star service without the price then this is the place to come.				
3228999	50010441	I look forward to returning in the very near future.				

3326055	50010450	Trendy doesn't quite cut it!		80011020	citizenJay-Clarke, Thank you for posting your thoughts for other travellers.	
3326055	50010451	---SEP---		80011021	Happy to read you enjoyed the ipad functions and the XL king-size bed.	
3326055	50010452	Really nice modern hotel, very little human interaction, check in is automated, you get an iPad which controls the lights, tv, temperature etc.....		80011022	I hope you're not missing those fluffy pillows too much!	
3326055	50010453	This iPad does everything apart from flush the toilet!.		80011023	See you around next time, citizenMarc	
3326055	50010454	The room itself is pretty basic and compact, but citezen M more than make up for it with stylish mood lighting and a massive bed.				
3326055	50010455	This is a great hotel and would definitely come back!				

3166495	50010460	Sea front great views just what you need for a holiday ---SEP---		80011034	Dear Robyn, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay with us.	
3166495	50010461	The room was great, amazing views, i could sleep upstairs away from my travelling partner watched ships come and go, Thai restaurant was handy and food was nice, Mark art front door was so helpfully and friendly, check in staff so polite.handy shops behind for the little things like a bottle of wine.!		80011035	Our staff love our beautiful environment at Golden Beach and clearly reflecting the same to our visiting Guests.	
3166495				80011036	We hope to see you soon again.	
3166495				80011037	With best regards, Rene Stern Resort Manager	

3238929	50010470	Quality ---SEP---		80011048	Thank you Ferndun for your super review and thank you also for reviewing The Spa on Trip Advisor's Blue Water Spa site.	
3238929	50010471	My wife visited today for a spa day with a friend and wanted me to comment on her behalf.		80011049	Delighted your wife and frine had a wonderful day and we look forward to seeing them again soon.	
3238929	50010472	The facilities were excellent as were the staff.		80011050	Best wishes David F Miller Managing Director	
3238929	50010473	The food in her own words was the best she had experienced in a long while.				
3238929	50010474	An all round excellent experience.				

3218249	50010480	Overstuffed room ---SEP---		80011061	Thank you for taking the time to post your comments about your recent stay at the Maligne Lodge.	
3218249	50010481	Our room was stuffed with furniture.		80011062	Your feedback regarding the furniture is greatly appreciated and has been forwarded to our head office.	
3218249	50010482	So much so, it was impossible to get from one bed to the other, or to get to the windows, or just the other side of the room if someone was sitting at the desk.		80011063	We hope that we can welcome you back to the Maligne Lodge on your next visit to Jasper.	
3218249	50010483	This room might work if you want 2 double beds for family & kids.				
3218249	50010484	But this really s/b a one bed room [either queen or king].				
3218249	50010485	It would make navigation & utilization of the room much better.				
3218249	50010486	And it could definitely could use a chair for seating.				
3218249	50010487	Our room came with a breakfast buffet, but we were on a tour, so that might not apply to all.				
3218249	50010488	Pretty good restaurant attached.				

3178019	50010490	Great hotel shame about the phones!		80011074	Dear Guest, I am delighted to hear that you felt the service was outstanding, the rooms comfortable and the food excellent.	
3178019	50010491	---SEP---		80011075	I‚Äôm sorry you thought the phone charge was too high, however, this is determined to us by the telephone company.	
3178019	50010492	We visited as part of a conference last week and as usual the service was outstanding, the rooms comfortable and the food excellent.		80011076	I assure you this is a standard hotel telephone charge across the country and that you will pay the same at other UK hotels.	
3178019	50010493	Only issue was the phones.		80011077	I hope this would not put you off visiting us again.	
3178019	50010494	I understand entirely that the phone signal was almost none existent out in Northumberland but was very disappointed at the very high landline costs when I needed to phone home for 3 mins.		80011078	Kind regards, Bernard Bloodworth Managing Director	
3178019	50010495	A shame because everything else was so good and this felt like taking advantage				

3227477	50010500	Great bar staff and nice rooms and breakfast ---SEP---		80011089	Greetings!	
3227477	50010501	My nephews wanted some wild frappuccinos that weren't available at the mini Starbucks but James was able to make a Rolo Frappuccino for them which they loved.		80011090	Thank you so much for taking the time to post this great review here on Trip Advisor!	
3227477	50010502	Sarah and Kimmy kept them entertained as well.		80011091	I will make sure to share this with James, Sarah, and Kimmy, they pride themselves on giving great service!	
3227477	50010503	Good job.		80011092	We hope to have you back soon and make you a Frappuccino of your desire.

3295365	50010510	Brilliant might away ---SEP---		80011105	Dear Guest, Thank you so much for taking the time to write this wonderful review about our Hotel.	
3295365	50010511	Well I stayed here for the night with a friend and we had separate rooms and both were very nice and beside each other.		80011106	We were delighted to read you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3295365	50010512	We decided to have fruit delivered to both rooms and it was good value fOr money.		80011107	I f you would like to contact me directly next time you stay I would personally be happy to organise a room with a sea view so that your stay here is nothing less than perfect.	
3295365	50010513	Room was lovely and big view was not great		80011108	We look forward to welcoming back again soon, Kind regards Louise O'Hara +35391538300 Sales Manager	
3295365	50010514	but you cannot have everything.				
3295365	50010515	Food was amazing in the bar and breakfast was good too.				
3295365	50010516	We both had a lovely time and it was worth the money				
3295365	50010517	but I am afraid it is a treat only once in a while				
3295365	50010518	but well worth it.				
3295365	50010519	We will be back again someday though.				

3277356	50010520	Great service, spotless hotel ---SEP--- I stayed here when attending an event in the 3 Arena, The hotel is 30 seconds from the arena and also the luas tram service which makes it easy to access the city centre.		80011119	Dear SimpleThingsRight, I am delighted to read that you and your partner had an ideal stay and that your stay was faultless.	
3277356	50010521	Our room was spotlessly clean and vibrant with everything we needed.		80011120	Thank you for taking the time to share your experience of the gibson hotel with the tripadvisor community.	
3277356	50010522	The staff were very friendly and the food was great.		80011121	It really is pleasing to read that our guests have enjoyed their stay.	
3277356	50010523	I really can't fault The Gibson , for us, as a couple attending an event in the 3 Arena it was ideal.		80011122	I have shared your lovely review with all the team here and we hope to welcome you back again soon.	
3277356				80011123	Kind Regards, Evans Sarpong assistant guest relations manager	

3281037	50010530	Bathroom dirty ---SEP---		80011134	Thank you for taking the time to write this review.	
3281037	50010531	The only bad thing was the tub in the bathroom was dirty.		80011135	I am sorry to hear that the bathroom was dirty.	
3281037	50010532	I think it could have been cleaned a little better.		80011136	This has been addressed to our housekeeping staff.	
3281037				80011137	We take pride in our customer service and hope you will stay with us again.	

3167961	50010540	Short but enjoyable stay ---SEP---		80011148	Dear DeeKinn, Thank you so much for your review following your recent stay with us at The Ashe Hotel.	
3167961	50010541	We recently spent a Saturday night here.		80011149	It was wonderful to read how much you and your extended family enjoyed your stay and found the hotel to offer clean and comfy rooms, plentiful cook to order breakfast in Alfies with lots of options.	
3167961	50010542	We had a lovely lunch in the bar and a very enjoyable evening in the lounge where we were joined by other family.		80011150	I will be sure to share your kind words with our team.	
3167961	50010543	Breakfast was plentiful and there were lots of options available.		80011151	Thank you once again and we look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	
3167961	50010544	The room was very comfortable.		80011152	Warm wishes Ruth O'Sullivan Group General Manager	
3167961	50010545	Would have enjoyed the option of a bath in the ensuite but could not fault the large powerful shower.				

3214269	50010550	Bathroom is filthy and lack of service over long weekend ---SEP---		80011163	Hello KElly, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with Quest Shepparton and we are saddened to see that you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay.	
3214269	50010551	We chose Quest as we have always had good experiences- a reliable choice.		80011164	Please be assured that your feedback has been noted so that it can be rectified as soon as possible.	
3214269	50010552	The room and bed lived up to expectations clean with a comfy bed.		80011165	I am unsure as to where you wrote to me as I did not receive any correspondence regarding this.	
3214269	50010553	However the bathroom did not.		80011166	I again apologise for any inconvenience caused.	
3214269	50010554	The tiles in the shower were covered in mould and soap scum, totally unacceptable.				
3214269	50010555	We wrote to the manager before posting this review, but a week later have still not heard anything.				
3214269	50010556	The reception staff were friendly and helpful.				
3214269	50010557	It was the Easter long weekend and we were advised that there was limited service staff on ie not all rooms would get serviced and this was certainly the case - ours was not touched.				
3214269	50010558	We found this amazing as the place was fully booked that weekend with lots of people there for a tennis comp across the road.				
3214269	50010559	We won't be back.				

3263390	50010560	Comfy stay ---SEP---		80011177	Hi Georgia, It was lovely to meet you when you passed through Picton.	
3263390	50010561	We were only here one night but had a lovely time, the room was clean, large and warm and Kerry was super friendly and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed.		80011178	I am glad your stay was enjoyable and thank you for posting your experience with us on Trip Advisor, we do appreciate you taking the time to do it.	
3263390	50010562	Would definitely stay again Georgia		80011179	Look forward to meeting up again if you are back this way, Kind regards, Kerry	

3308279	50010570	Great Stay tarred by breakfast experience ---SEP---		80011180	I apologise that on this occasion your breakfast did not meet your expectation.	
3308279	50010571	We have stayed a couple of times at the Headland, love the location, and everything about it.		80011181	Your comments have been forwarded to the Restaurant Manager and, as procedure, we do react to all feedback by reviewing internal training and service standards.	
3308279	50010572	However, this year over the course of one week we had terrible service at breakfast.		80011182	I can reassure you that since your stay in July measures have been put in place and I look forward to welcoming you back for a perfect Eggs Benedict next time!	
3308279	50010573	ordering eggs benidict seemed to be impossible.				
3308279	50010574	It came late, cold, only one muffin, not at all.				
3308279	50010575	it actually became a joke every morning.				
3308279	50010576	I did complain but nothing was done about it.				
3308279	50010577	my advice would be stay away from eggs benidict at the Headland and you will be fine here.				

3278766	50010580	Another brilliant holiday ---SEP---		80011193	Thank you for leaving this wonderful review.

3278766	50010582	I cannot recommend this place enough.		80011195	We look forward to seeing you very soon.

3278766	50010584	Fish and chips delicious, caravan was immaculate (coming from someone with OCD) very quiet site and staff are very friendly.				
3278766	50010585	Thank you for another brilliant stay, can‚Äôt wait till our holiday in June!!

3320297	50010593	From the doorman onwards it's friendly and professional.		80011209	It is certainly very popular with many of our guests.	
3320297	50010594	The Thai Restaurant off the foyer is excellent.		80011210	We hope that we will be able to welcome you back to stay again sometime soon Toby21Sydney.

3287521	50010633	This was our first visit to Quebec and the Eastern Townships.		80011258	Thank you again for being with us and we certainly hope to see you both again when you are back in our beautiful area!

3287521	50010636	my husband and I dined like royalty in their lovely sunroom.				
3287521	50010637	In the evening, it was nice to stroll around the waterfront which is only a couple of blocks away from the B&B. Louise and Richard are wonderful hosts who have thought of every detail to make guests feel welcome and comfortable.				
3287521	50010638	Thank you!				

3320496	50010640	Great boutique experience ---SEP---		80011260	Dear 'maddimcgowan', Thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

3320496	50010642	Very comfortable and clean, within easy walking distance of St Kilda pier and perfect for a weekend away.		80011262	Warm regards, Hayley A Hotel Manager	
3320496	50010643	We had no complaints, and especially enjoyed the attention to detail in the room like the inclusion of some magazines/coffee table books and a complementary branded notebook.				
3320496	50010644	Would absolutely stay again.				

3185661	50010650	Excellent Service ---SEP--- Stayed here on business for 3 nights.		80011273	Thank you for choosing the Epicurean Hotel for your recent business trip.	
3185661	50010651	Room is immaculately clean and housekeeping returns it to exactly the way it looked at check in each time it's cleaned.		80011274	I am pleased to hear that you had time to enjoy the hotel and our SoHo neighborhood!	
3185661	50010652	Room is spacious with very comfortable beds, upscale bath with robe and high end bath products.		80011275	We greatly appreciate your glowing review and we certainly hope that you stay with us whenever your travels bring you back to Tampa!	
3185661	50010653	A large television offers 80+ channels.		80011276	Tom Haines General Manager	
3185661	50010654	A work space and free Wifi are a bonus for business travelers.				
3185661	50010655	Location is very pleasant, just blocks from Tampa Bay and a variety of restaurants and bars.				
3185661	50010656	Neighborhood is tidy and safe.				
3185661	50010657	The best thing I can say about the hotel is that the customer service is excellent.				
3185661	50010658	The desk answers the phone and addresses you by name.				
3185661	50010659	Any request is promptly honored.				
3185661	50010660	Room service arrives in about 15 minutes.				
3185661	50010661	I didn't particularly care for the food here, but it was perfectly prepared.				
3185661	50010662	Just a matter of taste and what I'm used to.				
3185661	50010663	The chef is quite innovative and talented.				
3185661	50010664	There was a bit of noise from what I assume was the bar on the first night, but nothing worth taking away a star.				
3185661	50010665	Suited all my needs very nicely.				

3227367	50010670	Pet unfriendly.		80011287	I am very sorry to hear about your frustrations.	
3227367	50010671	---SEP--- Stayed on the 4th of July and the Radisson called to say there had been a complaint of our dog barking and we could not leave it unattended.		80011288	We want all of our guests to be satisfied, that is why even though we are absolutely pet friendly, we let our guests with pets know they can't be left alone in the room.	
3227367	50010672	That was not mentioned at the time of booking or checking into our room.		80011289	In this situation, your pet was disturbing the guest next door all day.	
3227367	50010673	Also, the millions of fireworks fired that night were a thousand decibels louder than my dog barking.		80011290	Again, this is just to foster the satisfaction of all our guests.	
3227367	50010674	This was certainly our last stay in this pet unfriendly environment.		80011291	Thank you for your understanding, and I hope you will give our hotel another chance to win your loyalty.	
3227367	50010675	Typical America.

3172677	50010682	Great location just off George St and opposite World Square which has supermarket and plenty of shopping.		80011304	We appreciate your loyalty to the Meriton Apartments, and look forward to welcoming you back to Kent Street again soon.	
3172677	50010683	Only a few minutes walk to Chinatown and Darling Harbour and very convenient to train station.		80011305	Kind Regards Meriton Kent Street Management	
3172677	50010684	I stayed in a studio which was spacious and had kitchenette.				
3172677	50010685	Excellent value for money if not staying a Saturday night however prices for Saturday seemed expensive everywhere in Sydney.				
3172677	50010686	This is the 3rd Meriton I have stayed in and would recommend and stay there again.

3227664	50010720	Cliff top idyll ---SEP--- An amazing villa in an incredible setting.		80011350	The Villas are in a magical setting and so pleased you enjoyed the views and the comfort of the Villas also.	
3227664	50010721	Wonderful views of the coastline from the patio area.		80011351	We are so fortunate to live near all the wonderful activities you mentioned.	
3227664	50010722	The villa is very spacious and comfortable.				
3227664	50010723	Within a moderate drive there are some incredible places for walking, climbing, surfing and other activities.				

3314082	50010730	Stunning accomodation, location, vista and experience at Norfolk Island.		80011362	Dear Guest, Thank you so much for your fantastic review of Hunky's Homestead at Tintoela.	
3314082	50010731	---SEP---		80011363	We are extremely happy to read that you and your extended family had such a positive travelling experience staying with us.	
3314082	50010732	I am a seasoned Norfolk Island visitor.		80011364	It is our aim to provide our guests with a 5 star experience and provide all that is needed for a relaxed and enjoyable holiday.	
3314082	50010733	This was my 9th visit; first time to Tintoela.		80011365	We are thrilled to read that this aim was achieved with full house of 13 guests.	
3314082	50010734	Tintoela was the best accommodation I have stayed in on the Island, and have no hesitations in recommending this property.		80011366	Thanks again for choosing to stay with us, we would love to welcome you back in the future.	
3314082	50010735	The accommodation was the most beautiful, spacious and glorious for a relaxed, enjoyable holiday.		80011367	Kind regards, Shaun.	
3314082	50010736	On this trip, we had a large group of my extended family (13 people: 7 Adults, 5 children, 1 infant) and we wanted somewhere we could stay together.				
3314082	50010737	Tintoela was ideal - perfectly comfortable, with a generous supply of tea/coffee/ local produce/ cake to welcome us, after being warmly greeted and welcomed by the property Manager, Shaun at the airport.				
3314082	50010738	(Shaun also graciously helped with leading us to the property and moving the associated luggage of 13 people!)				
3314082	50010739	Shaun took time to show us around the property and the accommodation (Hunky's homestead), had our hire cars ready and organised times for us to take our complimentary Norfolk Island 1/2 day tour.				
3314082	50010740	We were delighted by the amenities provided, the thoughtful provision of beach towels, WIFI, fan, local mobile phone with credit for us to use to contact Shaun directly, book restaurants or tours on island, and many books about the Island, ready for us to enjoy.				
3314082	50010741	So thoughtful!				
3314082	50010742	But, my favourite part of the home was the VIEW!				
3314082	50010743	Stunning - the porch (complete with comfortable chairs and tables) was the perfect place to sip a glass a wine, enjoy the beautiful garden, stare out to sea and unwind in the gentle breeze from the sea.				
3314082	50010744	Perfection!				

3246144	50010750	Lovely stay ---SEP--- Lovely stay at the Devonshire on a short break in Bath.		80011378	Thanks for taking the time to review your stay with us and for your kind comments.	
3246144	50010751	Room clean and tidy but somewhat smaller than we exspected.		80011379	Due to the age of the property, the room sizes are out of our control, so, much as we would love larger rooms we are defined (and benefit) by the character of the house.	
3246144	50010752	This was not a problem as we used it purely as a base for our visit.		80011380	Best regards Louise	
3246144	50010753	Breakfast really good and cooked to order by Judith.				
3246144	50010754	Judith was also really helpful in telling us about the area, bus routes and restaurants.				
3246144	50010755	We walked to and from the hotel each day, it took us about 20 mins.				

3296647	50010760	Beautiful B&B with perfect hosts!		80011391	Many thanks to you both for this wonderful review.	
3296647	50010761	---SEP---		80011392	It was a great delight to have you as our guests, thank you for choosing to stay with us.	
3296647	50010762	My sister and I stayed at Reef Point B&B for 2 nights and absolutely loved it.		80011393	Picking you up at the bus was no problem.	
3296647	50010763	We stayed in the whale song suite which overlooked the ocean and was only a couple of steps from the outdoor hot tub with a view!		80011394	Although not too far to walk, it is not much fun in the dark.	
3296647	50010764	We didn't have a car and arrived in Ucluelet by bus planning to take a taxi to the B&B (as we thought we might not find it in the dark).		80011395	I hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip in the Pacific Rim.	
3296647	50010765	But to our surprise Brian and Dian were at the bus stop to welcome and pick us up!		80011396	Best Wishes Dian and Brian	
3296647	50010766	Brian also kindly drove us back to the bus stop when we were leaving.				
3296647	50010767	Breakfast was beautifully prepared by Dian and our being vegetarian was not an issue.				
3296647	50010768	This place is a must stay - Incredible views, great room and wonderful hosts.				
3296647	50010769	I don't usually write reviews				
3296647	50010770	but I don't want anyone to miss out on this gem of a B&B!				

3175169	50010780	Average Hotel ---SEP--- Stayed in this hotel weekend of 23rd September for three nights.		80011407	Dear Dollysligo, Thank you for taking the time to leave this brief comment on our TripAdvisor page.	
3175169	50010781	This hotel is 7/8 minutes from Paddington Station.		80011408	Unfortunately, we were not able to locate your reservation in our system.	
3175169	50010782	Rooms are small.		80011409	Perhaps you could contact our Duty Managers on dm@parkgrandpaddingtoncourt.co.uk and discuss your dissatisfaction in more detail.	
3175169	50010783	"We were told we were ""upgraded"" to a basement bedroom!"		80011410	Kind regards, Vinayak Girgune General Manager	
3175169	50010784	"It was a small bedroom, with a 4' 6"" lumpy bed."				
3175169	50010785	The view out of the window was awful.				
3175169	50010786	Soiled carpets on stairs.				
3175169	50010787	No lounge area except a cafe type bar.				
3175169	50010788	Given a leaky iron and when I went to unplug it, the entire casing came away from the wall leaving wires hanging out.				
3175169	50010789	Breakfast was fine, but they were constantly running out of one type of food or other.				
3175169	50010790	Best thing about the stay was the mobile phone that is allocated to the room with internet.				
3175169	50010791	Would I stay there again..				
3175169	50010792	"definitely ""no""."				

3286323	50010800	Great Hotel ---SEP--- Beautiful lobby and breakfast area.		80011421	Good day Kent and thank you for staying with us at the Home Inn & Suites Saskatoon.	
3286323	50010801	Rooms were clean and modern.		80011422	I am so happy that our hotel and it's proximity to the outlets you mentioned, met with your needs.	
3286323	50010802	Beds were very comfortable.		80011423	I hope that you will have another opportunity to stay with us again soon.	
3286323	50010803	We would stay here again.		80011424	Tom	
3286323	50010804	The hotel was in walking distance of Sobey's, shoppers, starbucks, rock creek and a liquor store.				

3280916	50010810	Great Experience ---SEP---		80011435	Thank you very much for your review.	
3280916	50010811	We had the opportunity to spend 10 days at the Chateau Regina.		80011436	It was our pleasure having you as a guest in our hotel and we look forward to seeing you again.	
3280916	50010812	I have got to say that the front end staff, including the General Manager Bev Herperger were by far the best staff we have ever dealt with.		80011437	Sincerely, Bev Herperger General Manager	
3280916	50010813	Not only were they sypathetic to a horrible experience we had to deal with, they did everything in their power to make our stay enjoyable and comforting.				
3280916	50010814	We will remember this forever and appreciate it very much.				
3280916	50010815	We look forward to our stay again in 2012.				

3283589	50010820	Nice Property and Excellent Location ---SEP---		80011448	Thank you very kindly for taking the time out of your day to review our vibrant hotel.	
3283589	50010821	The property is very nice, heavenly beds and all.		80011449	I would like to offer my sincerest apologies that certain aspects of your most recent stay with us was disappointing.	
3283589	50010822	The rooms could use a bit of sprucing up and I wish the Starbucks had better hours.		80011450	We strive to satisfy each and every guest during their stay.	
3283589	50010823	The only thing is the meeting service is not the most attentive when the manager or meeting coordinator is not available.		80011451	I will pass along your feedback to my team so we may address the concerns in which you provided.	
3283589				80011452	I hope you will return in the near future so that we may offer you a true Westin experience.	
3283589				80011453	Be well, Toby Scott-Long, Hotel Manager	

3229876	50010830	Very nice nice staff, very loud morning!		80011464	Hiya, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us.	
3229876	50010831	---SEP---		80011465	I am happy to hear you enjoyed the majority of your stay with us with the noise in the morning disturbing you.	
3229876	50010832	Traveling on business and was checking in late.		80011466	Apologies for and disappointment this caused, there are do not disturb signs that you can place on your handle at night and the team will be aware not to knock on your door.	
3229876	50010833	Even after checking in online it too quite a while to check in a group, but the staff were very nice.		80011467	I do hope we can welcome you again soon, Kristy	
3229876	50010834	In the morning despite the do not disturb sign in my door the house keeping knocked and shouted in at 9.45am to ask me if I was leaving today or not.				
3229876	50010835	I must have been next to utility room, but the staff were so loud, banging in the rooms upstairs, talking loudly between rooms, it was a cranky start to the day.				
3229876	50010836	Breakfast was pretty poor for almost ¬£8 a person.				
3229876	50010837	Granted I came down just before close, but it felt a little rubbish.				
3229876	50010838	One of my group had damp on the sheets of the single bed in his room.				
3229876	50010839	All in all, the staff were super nice here and my room was clean and comfortable.				
3229876	50010840	But overall it just felt badly run.				

3310925	50010850	Boutique modern hotel on the beach.		80011478	Thank you for taking the time to write your wonderful review.	
3310925	50010851	STAY HERE!		80011479	It was a pleasure to help you out and make your NZ holiday enjoyable.	
3310925	50010852	---SEP---		80011480	Westport is certainly trying to change it's perception overseas and is an important link in the Westcoast Experience with its seascapes, lush rainforest and limestone arches and caves.	
3310925	50010853	We stayed here to break up the drive from Franz Josef to Blenheim.		80011481	Thank you again for choosing to stay with us.	
3310925	50010854	What a treat!				
3310925	50010855	"Westport was listed in one travel guide as ""with nothing to attract a passerby"" ... but Carters by the Sea is about 6km south and in a lovely little quiet and natural seaside town."				
3310925	50010856	Attached is a small bar/restaurant/grocery, and you can eat in Westport or in opposite direction to the south, Tauranga.				
3310925	50010857	Owners recommended Bay House which was perfect for us and the other couple we were traveling with.				
3310925	50010858	Hotel: first, it's called a motel, but for those among us Americans where that counjours a bad first impresstion -- IGNORE IT -- this is like a boutique hotel where you don't share a hallway.				
3310925	50010859	It is beautifully appointed and decorated, well stocked if you want to self cater.				
3310925	50010860	The grounds are cared for and in spectacular condition, like a great garden of flowers with small seating areas here and there.				
3310925	50010861	Location across from beach is beautiful.				
3310925	50010862	The beach is very long and gray with multiple layers of waves breaking offshore.				
3310925	50010863	There is almost nobody on the beach .... passed maybe 2 couples in about a mile.				
3310925	50010864	Interesting large driftwood, perfect for pictures.				
3310925	50010865	Service: Was friendly and very very helpful when we arrived and during our stay.				
3310925	50010866	When we left, we left a bag on our bed.				
3310925	50010867	We didn't realize it until we were 4 hours away in Marlborough, but the owners had tried to email us.				
3310925	50010868	When we called, they offered to ship the bag to us overnight to make sure it would arrive before we left Blenheim.				
3310925	50010869	Unbelievable service with a smile!				
3310925	50010870	The bag arrived safely less than 20 hours after we left it!				
3310925	50010871	And I'm sure the owners had to drive into Westport to get it posted and to us, but they gladly did it.				
3310925	50010872	Thank you Carters by the Beach!				
3310925	50010873	Highly recommended to all.				
3310925	50010874	Great location and really really wonderful place to stay.

3212887	50010883	Room and bathroom were very clean, staff was very helpful and we have already recommended this hotel!		80011495	We appreciate your recommendation and hope to welcome you back soon!	

3313480	50010890	Lucky Find! ---SEP---		80011506	Dear Fern B Thank you for your five star review of Dakota Glasgow.	
3313480	50010891	Having endured an awful night in Seamill, unable to sleep due to a hot, stuffy and noisy room on the main road we found this hotel on very short notice and were so glad we did.		80011507	It is so nice to read you were glad to have found Dakota and that we were able to give you an early check in and that the bedroom was lovely, cool and quiet.	
3313480	50010892	They allowed us to check in early to a lovely, cool and quiet room on the top floor and from then on things only got better.		80011508	I am delighted you had the chance to visit Glasgow as it is a very friendly, vibrant city, and I will pass your thanks on to Derek who will be pleased you liked the tips he gave you.	
3313480	50010893	Not planning on visiting Glasgow I am so pleased we did - the people were without exception very friendly and the inner city really interesting.		80011509	Attentive staff and stylish surroundings are hallmarks of Dakota so it is good to know we are achieving what we set out to do.	
3313480	50010894	A special thank you to Derek on the concierge desk - great tips for our journey to Inverness and a delight to talk to.		80011510	Hopefully we will welcome you back to Glasgow soon, and please do not hesitate to contact us on reservations@gla.dakotahotels.co.uk to assist with any future booking.	

3280684	50010900	Cincinnati Joe ---SEP--- Trim Castle Hotel was the perfect choice for the area.		80011521	Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing Trim Castle Hotel as your choice of places to stay for your recent visit to Trim Town and for taking the time to review us, we appreciate all feedback.	
3280684	50010901	Full service accommodations, great service, friendly staff wanting to assist in every way.		80011522	I am glad you enjoyed your visit to the Hotel.	
3280684	50010902	We were able to see the Castle from our room.		80011523	We hope you get the chance to visit us again here in Trim.	
3280684	50010903	Restaurant experience was great.		80011524	Kind regards Patrick Reilly	
3280684	50010904	Food tasty, staff friendly and helpful.				
3280684	50010905	Convenient to other historical attractions and Ancient Ruins with in close proximity.				

3247426	50010910	Fuzzy switching on a year old reserved room.		80011535	Thank you for choosing The Kahala Hotel & Resort on your recent visit.	
3247426	50010911	---SEP---		80011536	We are disappointed to hear that your experience fell short of your expectations.	
3247426	50010912	The wait staff, and other people like them around hotel, are sweet and helpful, but the upper management has an attitude.		80011537	We've shared your concerns and comments with our management team so that we can look at ways to improve these areas.	
3247426	50010913	They had a plumbing problem with some rooms when we checked in, and although we had a year old reservation, they had to move someone else to our reserved room.		80011538	We really appreciate you bringing these issues to our attention.	
3247426	50010914	Another room 1142 had a lock that didn't lock and our safe in room had to be fixed.		80011539	Thank you again for your comments.	
3247426	50010915	The ONE pool is filled to the gills with the cutest little swimmers, unfortunately with bikini bottoms and no diapers.				
3247426	50010916	It's not hard to figure where they went to the bathroom.				
3247426	50010917	Have been going for years, but it has changed dramatically.				
3247426	50010918	Your reservation of a specific room can be changed by them, don't expect much, and then you won't be disappointed.				
3247426	50010919	The views are great, such a shame it is going down hill.				

3216395	50010920	Great Hotel ---SEP---		80011540	Aloha Shalej20, Thank you for choosing to stay with us here at the OHANA Waikiki East by Outrigger!

3200158	50010930	Party Central kept Awake until 4:30 ---SEP---		80011556	Thank you for the compliments on the hotel upgrades and the restaurant and services.	
3200158	50010931	A well done renovation of a classical cold weather Canadian hotel.		80011557	Apologies for the delay in responding, as we did want to investigate this further and discuss internally.	
3200158	50010932	A big interior space with pools plants and lots of room.		80011558	As you mentioned there is now a service to the Cascades Casino available to and from the hotel, however it was not related to the disturbance you endured.	
3200158	50010933	Big rooms to match and the same can be said of the Sports Bar and Restaraunt.		80011559	Surprisingly, on the night you stayed our front desk team had some issues with a member of a group staying with us for meetings.	
3200158	50010934	We have eaten dinner and stayed the night each of our trips to Calgary this year.		80011560	We did try to contact you directly after the fact, however there was no email on file and the phone number on file was incorrect.	
3200158	50010935	This was our third stay in the last twelve months but almost certainly our last.		80011561	As we are very sorry to hear they disturbed your rest, please review your credit card statement to see that there was a credit made to your account as a type of amends for this incident.	
3200158	50010936	They even have a shuttle to the Casino.		80011562	We do hope to welcome you back in the future for a restful sleep and a comfortable stay.	
3200158	50010937	Maybe that's the problem.		80011563	Safe travels to you.	
3200158	50010938	We were wakened at 2:15 and called the desk to ask them to quiet our neighbours yelling and laughing.				
3200158	50010939	The night clerk came immediately.				
3200158	50010940	They stayed quiet for about 15 minutes.				
3200158	50010941	Pulled a pillow over my head and tried to go back to sleep.				
3200158	50010942	Got to sleep about 4:30.				
3200158	50010943	Keep your fingers crossed you are not next to the party crowd.				
3200158	50010944	I would have still recommend the Hotel as it was clean the food was good and the staff friendly EXCEPT FOR THIS: We know the Night clerk was there four times.				
3200158	50010945	We had to be up early and noticed the noisy room had a do not disturb sign on their door!!!				
3200158	50010946	"No ""sorry about that."				
3200158	50010947	"We sure hope you come back next time you are town?"""				

3172337	50010950	Breakfast area ---SEP---		80011574	Thank you for taking the time to post a review.	
3172337	50010951	Hot continental breakfast was non existent .		80011575	We're sorry that the breakfast attendant wasn't able to keep up with the high demand of breakfast during your stay.	
3172337	50010952	Hot serving tray was empty , bagel & muffin area was empty.		80011576	We hope you enjoyed the waffles!	
3172337	50010953	Only thing my family of 5 had to eat was the waffles.				
3172337	50010954	Worker was overwhelmed .				
3172337	50010955	We usually stay here with sports teams, may have to reconsider.				

3189101	50010960	Very good - excellent for city centre ---SEP--- Stopped over for a concert at the football ground which is about 2 miles away.		80011587	Dear SomersetRickyDude, Thank you for taking the time tot review your recent stay with us and thank you for your great feedback.	
3189101	50010961	The hotel communal areas are very clean and well designed, the room was great with a massive queen size bed and super comfy.		80011588	It is great to read about our guest having such a comfortable and enjoyable stay.	
3189101	50010962	The parking is very limited especially as it is open to non-residents, we ended up parking in the St David's multi-storey which added another ¬£20 to the cost.		80011589	We hope to see you back at the hotel again very soon.	
3189101	50010963	But we got the hotel at a cheap price so didn't feel too ripped off!		80011590	Kindest Regards Clare Thomas Front Office Manager	

3293555	50010970	Brilliant location and friendly staff ---SEP--- Really good area for any shows in the West End - would recommend going to the Scoff and Banter which is the cocktail bar down stairs as they do excellent cocktails!		80011601	Dear Toby W, Thank you for offering y our valued feedback.	
3293555	50010971	I would reccomend going for the slightly larger room as they are quite small but if you are out and about all day it shouldn't be an issue		80011602	It is always useful for us as well as our future customers.	
3293555				80011603	I would like to invite you to also drop a comment on the Scoff & Banter mercer street‚Äôs trip advisor page if you would like too.	
3293555				80011604	I am sure our restaurant manager would be delighted.	
3293555				80011605	Feel free to contact myself for any future assistance in making reservations in the hotel or in our wonderful bar.

3181489	50011023	We have stayed at this location a few times in the past and the motel is showing it's age.				
3181489	50011024	Our internet was extremely spotty, but our room was located on the far end of the motel.				
3181489	50011025	The shower had great water pressure but the drain was very slow so you were standing in water.

3181019	50011043	Beautiful yard which we were allowed to use for family photos.		80011683	We often get grandparents, parents and children over 5 are always welcome...but 5 not 6 is pretty much max for that suite.

3315095	50011091	Situated a short distance from the main shops at Coolum - The Point was the perfect location and setting to take the in-laws visiting from the UK.		80011744	We're so glad that you enjoyed your stay.	
3315095	50011092	Breathtaking ocean views from the bedrooms, combined with the soothing sound of the ocean to fall asleep to made for a pleasant stay.		80011745	We did our very best to get the master bed air-con unit back working late in the day and I'm sorry to discover that it continued to play up after I thought it fixed.	
3315095	50011093	Living room and kitchen were spacious - complete with modern fixtures.		80011746	There was definitely a larger issue with it as it is now being replaced.	
3315095	50011094	Lock up garage was an added bonus too and complimented the overall appeal and appreciation of the villa.		80011747	Hopefully your in-laws have already forgiven you (and us!)	
3315095	50011095	The only negative was the air-con in the master bedroom was faulty and despite friendly maintenance/management staff attempting to fix it - the unit still didn't work.		80011748	for their unexpectedly tropical Queensland adventure!	
3315095	50011096	It's only a minor problem, but in a bid to try and impress the in-laws - who were already struggling with the QLD summer heat and humidity - it wasn't ideal.		80011749	We'd love to welcome you and your fiancee back any time.	
3315095	50011097	Overall though, would definitely recommend to both tourists and locals alike and both the fianc√©e and I intend to visit again for a weekend away in the near future.				

3326213	50011100	Great place ---SEP---		80011750	I appreciate your feedback.	
3326213	50011101	We really enjoyed our stay there.		80011751	We will continue our efforts for better customer care.	
3326213	50011102	The staff was really great and very helpful.		80011752	Thank you.	
3326213	50011103	Close to shopping and to the restaurants.				
3326213	50011104	The breakfast was good.				
3326213	50011105	I am going to be staying there again when I go back.

3228724	50011111	They have hot pools to soak in after a long cool day.		80011764	Thank you for your feedback.	
3228724	50011112	only down side with the unit we had was the bedroom above had creaky floor boards and were really annoying.		80011765	As new owners we welcome your suggestions on how we can improve your stay and will be looking into what we can do to solve the issue you had.	
3228724	50011113	couple of areas in the bathroom were in need of attention but we enjoyed our stay and will be back.		80011766	We are doing up the property over time and look forward to seeing you back here again soon.	

3302854	50011120	Perfect city centre pad ---SEP--- Stayed for one night.		80011777	Dear Jazlin C Thank you for the wonderful review.	
3302854	50011121	Great accommodation.		80011778	I am pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay and will be sure to pass on your kind words to our reception team.	
3302854	50011122	Clean and good standard.		80011779	We look forward to seeing you again soon at any of our fantastic aparthotels situated in Newcastle, Chester, Nottingham, Manchester and London Stratford.	
3302854	50011123	Really spacious....		80011780	Kidn Regards James C Assistant Hotel Manager	
3302854	50011124	great to have a seating area not just a bed.				
3302854	50011125	Really fall ross, quiet at night.				
3302854	50011126	Front desk staff friendly and helpful.				
3302854	50011127	Awesome breakfast next door.				
3302854	50011128	Highly recommended!!!				

3170159	50011130	Very good ---SEP---		80011791	Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences with us, Stewart-Little53!	
3170159	50011131	The one bedroom apartment was well appointed and had a good view over the harbour.		80011792	It's always a pleasure to see that we were able to provide you with a well-appointed luxury suite for your visit to Sydney!	
3170159	50011132	My one gripe had to do with the lifts and that was that they were very slow.		80011793	Our suites certainly do feature some phenomenal views over the iconic harbour, so we are pleased you had been able to enjoy it!	
3170159	50011133	This is probably because there is still work going on to finish a couple of floors and maybe a couple of the lifts aren't working at the moment - or have been tied up by construction crews.		80011794	Kind regards, Amanda H Online Reputation Team	
3170159	50011134	Whatever the reason this is a small gripe as I said and if it comes good when the other floors are opened up then everything will be great.				

3168524	50011140	Peace and Quiet in the South West ---SEP---		80011805	Your great review really fits the bill, too Emma C, and I think you've pretty much said it all.	
3168524	50011141	If it's a peaceful, quiet weekend away you need, then Inn the Tuarts really fits the bill.		80011806	And it's certainly true, that what more of our guests love than just about anything else, is the peace and quiet escape from all the busy, busy of modern life.	
3168524	50011142	The accommodation is set in the tranquility of the Tuart forest, far enough away from roads to hear any traffic, and yet still only 5 minutes drive from Busselton Town Centre.		80011807	Thank you so much for your generous comments about the facilities, staff, rooms, beds and the breakfast, all of which are important, of course and we are committed to continuous improvement and upgrades, but there's not a lot we can add to the majestic old Tuart trees, some hundreds of years old, the local birds and kangaroos and the tranquillity of the semi-rural, forest setting which is, as you point out, only around 5 minutes from the all the shops, cafes, pubs, restaurants, etc in Busselton town.	
3168524	50011143	The facilities are excellent and the staff give a warm welcome.		80011808	Do come back again, soon, we love it when our friends return.	
3168524	50011144	Th rooms are immaculate, the beds are comfortable and the breakfast is magnificent!		80011809	All the best, Pete and Suzanne	
3168524	50011145	We thoroughly recommend this venue.				

3222106	50011150	August 2016 stay at Travelodge Cardiff Atlantic Wharf ---SEP--- Clean hotel.		80011810	Thank you for submitting your feedback.	
3222106	50011151	Conveniently located for Cardiff Bay and the Doctor		80011811	We can kindly confirm our Cardiff Atlantic Wharf hotel does not offer twin room accommodation.	
3222106	50011152	Who experience.		80011812	We're pleased you found our hotel to be clean and conveniently located for your adventures round the area.	
3222106	50011153	Good parking.		80011813	It's also great to hear you thoroughly enjoyed our bar/cafe breakfast choices.	
3222106	50011154	Friendly staff.		80011814	Thanks again for taking the time to review our hotel, we do hope to see you again in the future.	
3222106	50011155	Great breakfast range.				
3222106	50011156	However, we asked for a twin room, and they gave us a double.				
3222106	50011157	Twice our key card was disconnected.				
3222106	50011158	And also, they were advised when we booked that it was one of our party's birthday.				
3222106	50011159	The hotel did nothing.				

3190896	50011160	Exemplary customer service ---SEP---		80011825	Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us.	
3190896	50011161	It is now 2 years that I have been staying in hotels on business in Leeds		80011826	I am pleased to read that you find the staff of a high standard and put our customers first.	
3190896	50011162	and I think I have tried them all.		80011827	I look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future.	
3190896	50011163	The Rad Blu gets my vote on most criteria but above all the quality of its staff.		80011828	Regards Valerie Donaldosn General Manager	
3190896	50011164	They are professional, friendly and really helpful.				
3190896	50011165	They are always looking for ways to make your stay more convenient whether it be remembering your name to making sure that any bags you leave with them are waiting for you in your room.				
3190896	50011166	Particular stars are Brinda, Dan and Joy.				
3190896	50011167	Thanks team for making the hotel my home from home.				

3304421	50011170	Marcus is the man!		80011839	Dear The nightmares, Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel.	
3304421	50011171	---SEP---		80011840	The entire staff was so pleased to hear how much you enjoyed the above and beyond service that Marcus from our Valet Department provided for you and your daughter during the recent Florida Bar Exam.	
3304421	50011172	While the rooms were underwhelming, and there were issues with the reservation, Marcus was awesome.		80011841	We are fortunate to have him as part of our staff as Marcus has been a member of the Sheraton Team for a very long time.	
3304421	50011173	He is the most helpful, kind associate at the hotel.		80011842	Starting in July, the hotel will be undergoing a major renovation which includes new bedding, all new guestroom furniture, carpeting, artwork, lamps, new windows and new sliding glass doors.	
3304421	50011174	From the minute he met us, he was funny and willing to help us in anyway.		80011843	Our corridors and the lobby will be renovated as well.	
3304421	50011175	It was when he saw my daughter start to panic (she was taking the bar exam and the room was wrong) that he went above and beyond.		80011844	In addition our pool area will receive all new pavers and we are also building a large outdoor Pool Bar for our guest to enjoy on those warm and sunny afternoons.	
3304421	50011176	He not only got us set up in a more spacious room, but also got us the balcony that we had been promised in the original reservation (the room we were given did not have a balcony).		80011845	On behalf of the entire Sheraton Team, we thank you for your business and we hope to welcome you back in the very near future.	
3304421	50011177	The staff is general were kind, but Marcus was outstanding.		80011846	Warm Regards, Maryann White, General Manager	
3304421	50011178	The rest of our stay was made better by the kindness of this man.				

3322377	50011180	Highpoint of a road trip ---SEP---		80011857	Good Afternoon DB1939, Thank you for sharing your recent experience at The Grampians Motel and The Views Restaurant.	
3322377	50011181	Grounds with lots of open green space (and a kids' playground), an overwhelming view of nearby crests and pinnacles, a perfectly comfortable room, an unexpectedly fine dinner (and convenient breakfast) at the onsite restaurant, persistent visits by kangaraoos, emus, and sulphur-crested cockatoos: not (to say the least) what this holiday traveller is accustomed to.		80011858	Its always pleasing to read positive feedback like yours.	
3322377	50011182	But exactly what he deserves.		80011859	It reinforces that what we do here is great and helps us understand that we are on the right path with what we provide each and every guest.	
3322377				80011860	We look forward to the next time we can host you at the motel!	
3322377				80011861	Regards, Andrew Damm Motel Manager	

3171423	50011190	The Property Is Beautiful		80011872	Thank you so much for taking the time to post a review on Trip Advisor.	
3171423	50011191	But...Worst Hyatt In The USA!		80011873	I am disappointed that your visit with us was not as pleasant as we all would have liked.	
3171423	50011192	---SEP---		80011874	Your feedback is appreciated as it allows me to perfect our service moving forward.	
3171423	50011193	Like the title of my review says the outside part of the hotel is beautiful.		80011875	Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconsistent service you received during your experience with us.	
3171423	50011194	The landscaping is plush.		80011876	Thank you for your time to review the property, and we hope that we can rebuild your trust in us so if your travels bring you back to the Fort Lauderdale area please contact me directly so that I may assist you with your accommodations.	
3171423	50011195	The pools are breathtaking and the grass is uber green.		80011877	All the best Glenn Spanier General Manager Haytt Regency Pier 66 glenn.spanier@hyatt.com 954-525-6666	
3171423	50011196	Everything about the hotel on the outside is beautiful.				
3171423	50011197	DO NOT LET THE LOBBY AND THE LANDSCAPING FOOL YOU!				
3171423	50011198	If you notice one thing 90% of the reviews of this hotel are good and posted by people who have only ever posted one review.				
3171423	50011199	That is something to be skeptical about to begin with.				
3171423	50011200	Notice that most of the negative reviews are posted by people who use tripadvisor alot.				
3171423	50011201	Something to think about!				
3171423	50011202	We got this hotel thru the name your own price feature thru Priceline so we were stuck with it.				
3171423	50011203	My boyfriend and I decided to go on a romantic trip at a local hotel as we live in ft lauderdale.				
3171423	50011204	Having never been to this hotel we figured it would be nice because its a Hyatt.				
3171423	50011205	Boy we were in for a rude awakening!				
3171423	50011206	The first room they put us in smelled very moldy and was disgusting.				
3171423	50011207	As I said my boyfriend and I wanted a romantic weekend, they only had rooms with doubles.				
3171423	50011208	Why hotels in 2011 put doubles in rooms and not queen beds is beyond me.				
3171423	50011209	The room also had the nosiest AC unit I have ever heard.				
3171423	50011210	It was like an upgraded Motel 6 room.				
3171423	50011211	"We told management about the room being displeasing and they ""upgraded"" us complimentary to a different room type."				
3171423	50011212	It was in fact a little nicer but the air conditioning did not work at all.				
3171423	50011213	The room had a beautiful view of the pool but the AC not working in the room caused alot of problems.				
3171423	50011214	The room was supposed to have a fridge, you can tell because of the furniture had a fridge space, when u open the door it was empty with a big hole in the back of it.				
3171423	50011215	"When requested a fridge they ""ran out""."				
3171423	50011216	Well they should of been in the rooms to begin with.				
3171423	50011217	My boyfriend and I really wanted to stay so that we could have a romantic evening but decided the plush landscaping wasnt worth a room with no AC and checked out.				
3171423	50011218	Management was completely unapologetic and could care less.				
3171423	50011219	This hotel is the reason I will never use a Priceline name your own price feature ever again.				

3278461	50011220	High tea still needs improving!		80011888	Dear Lauren H, Thank you very much for choosing Chateau Tongariro for your recent stay and for taking the time to leave a review of your experience.	
3278461	50011221	---SEP---		80011889	It is regretful and we are deeply disappointed that your experience with us was not so pleasant and we sincerely apologize for that.	
3278461	50011222	My boyfriend and I booked for high tea.		80011890	While we wish you had better experience with us it is feedback like this which gives us the opportunity to improve our services for future guest.	
3278461	50011223	The setting is beautiful, with views overlooking Mt. Doom, and the service is good (particularly our server, Donald).		80011891	We have shared your feedback with our concerned Head of departments who undoubtedly will work upon your constructive feedback to improve services for our future guests.	
3278461	50011224	Unfortunately the afternoon tea itself is very disappointing.		80011892	"On a positive not e we are pleased that you enjoyed the service provided by our staff especially ""Donald' who will be delighted to hear your feedback."	
3278461	50011225	The portion sizes are very small (in particular the scones are two small mouthfuls - picture is portion for two) and the savouries were somewhat bland.		80011893	We appreciate your valuable feedback and look forward to welcome you again.	
3278461	50011226	Further, the egg sandwich barely had any filling and tasted like it had just come out of the fridge!		80011894	Best Regards	
3278461	50011227	Overall very disappointing for $45/pp.				

3225927	50011230	Lives up to it's excellent ratings!		80011905	Dear Aaron, thank you for your kind review of our Homewood Suites in downtown Denver.	
3225927	50011231	---SEP--- Wanted a special place to stay over Christmas with my family and chose this hotel based on it's solid ratings.		80011906	I shared your review with our team to recognize their efforts in providing 5-Star service to our guests.	
3225927	50011232	It did not disappoint us and exceeded what we expected!		80011907	We look forward to serving you again in the future.	
3225927	50011233	Everything here is top notch.				
3225927	50011234	From the very friendly and helpful service to the hotel itself.				
3225927	50011235	The complimentary meals were both delicious and some of the most varied I have seen from a hotel.				
3225927	50011236	Location is great if wanting to walk over to the 16th Street Mall, Denver Convention Center, or Denver Pavilions.				
3225927	50011237	The lobby is very spacious with lots of places to sit.				
3225927	50011238	Eating area is also spacious and accommodating.				
3225927	50011239	We were in a mountain view suite and very, very pleased with the room.				
3225927	50011240	One could easily feel at home here with its nice layout and convenient amenities.				
3225927	50011241	Design of rooms are contemporary and show no signs of wear and tear.				
3225927	50011242	Pool area is nice and well kept.				
3225927	50011243	Fitness area is larger than most hotels.				
3225927	50011244	Elevators are fast and rarely is it more than a 15 second wait for one.				
3225927	50011245	Only at 5-Star hotels have I encountered where each and every hotel staff member is friendly, helpful and greets you.				
3225927	50011246	This is a first outside of a 5-Star resort I can say this about.				
3225927	50011247	They made our Christmas extra special!				
3225927	50011248	Thank you!				

3204840	50011250	Great Service ---SEP---		80011918	Thank you for your five-star review of our Embassy Suites!	
3204840	50011251	Great stay at the Embassy Suites.		80011919	We always try and accommodate our guests at any hours of the day, so it is great to hear that you were able to get settled into your room right away.	
3204840	50011252	When I arrived, there was a large group departing and at first, it was difficult to locate a room for early check-in.		80011920	Please come back and be our guest for your next visit to Denver!	
3204840	50011253	However, one of the managers on duty (this was Tue morning around 10 AM) jumped in and got me checked in almost immediately.				
3204840	50011254	She was extremely helpful and friendly; I wish I had gotten her name for this review!				
3204840	50011255	I also ordered room service twice and was greeted by a very friendly and prompt Bridget, each time.				
3204840	50011256	Great hotel!				

3281432	50011260	Girls Weekend Getaway ---SEP---		80011931	Your review will be shared amongst all the team at Travelodge Hotel Sudbury.	
3281432	50011261	Our experience at this hotel was great from start to finish.		80011932	We are happy you enjoyed your stay and took advantage of our Perkins Restaurant.	
3281432	50011262	The day before I received an email offering an option to 'check in'.		80011933	We look forward to seeing you again.	
3281432	50011263	It was quick and easy to let them know roughly when we would be arriving, special instructions, and request where we wanted out room.		80011934	Stewart Marr General Manager	
3281432	50011264	We could have upgraded if we wanted.				
3281432	50011265	When we arrived, everything was ready.				
3281432	50011266	I showed ID and literally everything was ready.				
3281432	50011267	The room was clean, and modern for the most part.				
3281432	50011268	Our floor had an ice machine and pop machine, as well as some snacks we available at the front desk area for a reasonable price (some places are ridiculous).				
3281432	50011269	Front desk staff were friendly and professional no matter what time of day we saw them.				
3281432	50011270	Pool and hot tub area was nice, although I found the hot tub a bit hotter than I prefer.				
3281432	50011271	It was still very relaxing and clean.				
3281432	50011272	You'll have to ask for towels, as they don't have them in the pool area.				
3281432	50011273	We ate breakfast at Perkins, attached to the hotel.				
3281432	50011274	It was DELICIOUS!				
3281432	50011275	Very very well priced, huge portions, so many choices.				
3281432	50011276	I highly recommend eating there.				
3281432	50011277	Internet connection was the best I've had at any hotel.				
3281432	50011278	Overall we had an amazing weekend and absolutely our stay here was part of what made it so wonderful.				
3281432	50011279	Thank you!!

3319815	50011282	Deer fed twice a day-		80011947	While we are only 5 minutes away from the city centre by car and just off the New England Highway our guests do enjoy the quiet location.	
3319815	50011283	that's a bonus, especially for kids.		80011948	It is great to see that the addition of the dining room for dinner and breakfast is so well received by our guests.	
3319815	50011284	Quiet location.		80011949	We hope we can welcome you back on your next trip through Armidale.

3313597	50011290	Not as good as it sounded ---SEP--- not a very user friendly experience.		80011961	Dear H5360DNalisonm, Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.	
3313597	50011291	Did not realise at time of booking it was valet parking and a cost per day.		80011962	I am disappointed to hear that your stay did not meet expectations; for this please accept my sincerest apology.	
3313597	50011292	I would not stay here again.		80011963	H5360DNalisonm, most CBD hotels do charge for secured Valet Parking and I am sorry to know that this would prevent you from returning.	
3313597	50011293	certainly not value for money .		80011964	I am very however excited to report that we have completed works on 1 of the elevators and this is already making a huge difference.	
3313597	50011294	This hotel is located in a very good spot in the city.		80011965	I understand and apologize for the inconvenience caused by this upgrade and assure you that this was urgently required.	
3313597	50011295	I would like to have been told before hand that there was only one lift working as this just took forever to get anywhere.		80011966	I respect that you have a choice and hope you will choose to stay with us in future.	
3313597				80011967	Sincerely, Sid Bhatia General Manager	

3216019	50011300	Romance package ---SEP---		80011978	Thank you for your recent review of Hotel on Devonport.	
3216019	50011301	My wife and I stayed here for 1 night for our 1st anniversary.		80011979	We were delighted to hear you were happy with the room and our service.	
3216019	50011302	We booked the room and then paid an additional $70 for the romance package.		80011980	Thank you also for your feedback with regards to the bed, we are delighted to advise we are currently in the process of upgrading the beds in all of our rooms.	
3216019	50011303	This included a bottle of bubbles, 2 chocolates, a small teddy bear, cooked breakfast and a late check out (12pm).				
3216019	50011304	When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff.				
3216019	50011305	We got up to our room and they had put (fake) rose petals on the floor and bed.				
3216019	50011306	A little while later we were delivered our bottle of bubbles and our complementary glass of wine and chips.				
3216019	50011307	The room was to a high standard and very clean.				
3216019	50011308	The bed wasn't that comfortable and the 1 pillow we had each was worse.				
3216019	50011309	The cooked breakfast was very nice.				
3216019	50011310	My biggest complaint was not having any milk in the fridge for a morning coffee.				
3216019	50011311	Oh, and the cleaners trying to get into our room half an hour before check out while I was getting dressed after getting out of the shower.				
3216019	50011312	You also have to pay an extra $10 for parking which I thought was a bit on the nose.				

3174710	50011320	Amazing!		80011991	That's awesome Kaleigh S....	
3174710	50011321	---SEP---		80011992	thank you so much for the kind comments.	
3174710	50011322	I have been to many many many hotels around the world and by far this one tops the cake.		80011993	Our team loves reading reviews like this one.	
3174710	50011323	The reason it was so amazing was the service.				
3174710	50011324	I felt as if this is how you are supposed to be treated when paying for a place to stay either on vacation or at work.				
3174710	50011325	The staff were amazing!				

3169336	50011330	Wagner Hotel ---SEP--- Best hotel in Manhattan...		80012004	Thank you for the great rating and recommendations James M!	
3169336	50011331	David and Mohamed at the front desk always make it perfect!		80012005	We're thrilled you had a great stay with us!	
3169336	50011332	This is hotel is always first choice when we stay in Manhattan.		80012006	It's wonderful you appreciated our excellent facilities and service.	
3169336	50011333	We highly recommend it.		80012007	We look forward to hosting you again in the near future for an even more positive and luxurious experience.	
3169336	50011334	And I would always ask for David and Mohamed when you check in.		80012008	Best Regards, Alex Spektor Managing Director	

3265711	50011340	Fabulous! ---SEP---		80012019	Thank you for your five-day stay with us.	
3265711	50011341	For our girlfriend's outing we chose the Four Seasons because of its excellent location and stellar reputation.		80012020	Our corner suites are probably the most popular room type, so I'm glad you enjoyed the views.	
3265711	50011342	We were not disappointed.		80012021	We are definitely a busy hotel--in the heart of downtown's thriving theater and convention district--and our meeting spaces and bar reflect the hub-bub of excitement.	
3265711	50011343	Our 5 days there were fabulous.		80012022	We appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback and for your five-star rating!	
3265711	50011344	We were warmly welcomed the minute we stepped out of the cab.		80012023	Sincerely, Jim Guttau Director of Public Relations	
3265711	50011345	The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything we needed.				
3265711	50011346	We were upgraded to a wonderful corner suite with expansive windows that gave us an enthralling view of the city and the Colorado foothills.				
3265711	50011347	The room was clean and inviting.				
3265711	50011348	A fruit basket arrived soon after.				
3265711	50011349	(One of our party stays at the Four Seasons whenever she is in town).				
3265711	50011350	We requested a rollaway because we were a group of 3.				
3265711	50011351	I've never slept on a more comfortable rollaway.....it supplied all the comforts of a conventional bed.				
3265711	50011352	The housekeeping staff was very willing to give us extra coffee, etc.				
3265711	50011353	whenever we asked.				
3265711	50011354	And the sinks light up at night, giving off a soft glow for nighttime wanderings.				
3265711	50011355	One small glitch: on our last day there, our room hadn't been cleaned by 3:30.				
3265711	50011356	We learned that we could have requested early room make-ups when we checked in.				
3265711	50011357	The hotel was very busy, seeming to host a conference every day.				
3265711	50011358	And yes, the bar during Happy Hour was quite crowded and noisy......pretty much what one would expect.				
3265711	50011359	A recent reviewer was very dissatisfied with her stay, giving an overall rating of one star.				
3265711	50011360	"She claimed that the ""love, love"" reviews were bogus.....they are NOT!"				
3265711	50011361	This review is very, very real.				
3265711	50011362	And yes, I love the Four Seasons Denver and highly recommend it to everyone staying in downtown Denver.				

3247141	50011370	Very poor for the price ---SEP---		80012034	Dear Guest, Thank you for providing us with your feedback regarding your recent stay with us here at Jurys Inn Leeds.	
3247141	50011371	The hotel entrance and foyer give the appearance of a higher class hotel.		80012035	Firstly, may I offer my sincerest apologies for the issues you experienced during your stay at our hotel.	
3247141	50011372	How missleading that is.		80012036	This is not the normal standard which we strive to deliver at Jurys Inn Leeds and it is disappointing that we failed to meet your expectations on this occasion.	
3247141	50011373	The rooms are clean but the heating was so incredibly loud and innefective.		80012037	I can assure you that we take our guest‚Äôs comments very seriously as we strive to continuously improve the service of the hotel.	
3247141	50011374	It was very cold and impossible to sleep with the heating on due to the excessive load.		80012038	I can assure you that the issues that you have highlighted with be brought to the attention of the team and management so that they can be addressed.	
3247141	50011375	Breakfast was expensive and we had to wait for an age for a table, cutlery, food etc.		80012039	Whilst I realise that the hotel did not meet your expectations on this occasion, I hope that you will accept this apology in good faith and in the sincerity with which it is intended.	
3247141	50011376	Horrendous		80012040	I hope that the problems you have had during your stay will not deter you from using Jurys Inns again and I look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel in the future.	
3247141				80012041	Kind Regards Sabine Kurina Food and Beverage Manager	

3317378	50011380	Great hotel for the price ---SEP---		80012052	Kia ora Camper50070113265, Many thanks for sharing your positive feedback with us.	
3317378	50011381	I looked for a budget hotel because I was only sleeping there- early morning flight.		80012053	Kind regards	
3317378	50011382	But I was so impressed.				
3317378	50011383	It was so much more than I was expecting.				
3317378	50011384	Beautiful room, small but perfect, the food was good, and not expensive, and the bar had a happy hour.				
3317378	50011385	Would definitely stay again				

3171987	50011390	Great stay ---SEP--- Had a fantastic stay.		80012064	Dear Guest Thank you very much for taking the time to share your review your experience at the Mercure Glasgow City hotel.	
3171987	50011391	Room was spotless, staff were friendly breakfast was great everything you could think off to eat and great quality not like some of the breakfasts I have had at other hotels.		80012065	I was very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of the hotels ideal location.	
3171987	50011392	Location was fantastic.		80012066	I hope you will decide to stay with us again the next time you are in the area.	
3171987	50011393	Right next door to Corinthian and lots of other great bars!		80012067	Thanks again Monica Docherty General Manager	
3171987	50011394	Will be back an would recommend it to anyone who was planning on staying in Glasgow				

3213966	50011400	Great modern hotel in Belfast ---SEP---		80012078	Dear Kat H, I am delighted to read to the rooms and bar lived up to your expectations and that you recieved excellant and friendly service from all the staff.	
3213966	50011401	I was very pleased with our stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel.		80012079	I will certainly pass on your kind words with all the team at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast.	
3213966	50011402	The surroundings and the rooms were lush.		80012080	Thank you for taking the time to write such lovely feedback.	
3213966	50011403	My husband and I like to stay in nice hotels when we go away as it is our treat to ourselves and we were not disappointed.		80012081	I look forward to weloming you back to the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast in the not too distant future.	
3213966	50011404	The rooms are well equipped, clean and spacious.		80012082	Kindest Regards, Carolyn Matthews	
3213966	50011405	Adequate for the money we paid.				
3213966	50011406	The hotel is perfectly located with the town center and pubs/ bars within a walking distance.				
3213966	50011407	The hotel bar is quite expensive (as in any hotel) but the quality of the drinks is brilliant.				
3213966	50011408	Cocktails are amazing and you even get a freshly prepared lemonade if you order alcohol with lemonade (I urge anyone to try it)...				
3213966	50011409	The only slight negative was the breakfast.				
3213966	50011410	My husband is gluten intolerant and there was no gluten free option.				
3213966	50011411	It would not be a problem as he wanted to build his own breakfast with options he could have and ordered 2x eggs, bacon etc.				
3213966	50011412	When his breakfast turned up it had 1x egg, 2x rushers of bacon and 1x mushroom.				
3213966	50011413	Not a lot to be fair.				
3213966	50011414	We explained the situation to the waitress the next morning and asked for a bit more food.				
3213966	50011415	However, the same breakfast had turned up!				
3213966	50011416	My eggs benedicts was equally as pathetic.				
3213966	50011417	It was very tasty but only got one poached egg with some ham on a whole English muffin.				
3213966	50011418	The continental breakfast assortment was not great either.				
3213966	50011419	Only 2 different types of cold meats, some bread, slices of one type of cheese, butter, but no cream/ soft cheese and not a lot else.				
3213966	50011420	Granted there was a good selection of cereals and fresh fruit.				
3213966	50011421	I am not sure why the hotel would be stingy on breakfast when they excel at the rest of the stuff.				
3213966	50011422	Overall I would recommend the hotel as all the staff were excellent, friendly and could not help you enough and it was up to a very good standard.				

3235545	50011430	Not good value for money ---SEP---		80012093	Hi, Thank you for your feedback.	
3235545	50011431	We stayed at this motel between Christmas and New Year so the tariff was higher than normal.		80012094	Due to the days you stayed being public holidays room servicing was kept to a minimum.	
3235545	50011432	It is a quick walk from the 3 Sisters viewing platform and tourist area and this is a plus.		80012095	If this was not suitable for you we wish you had mentioned it to staff and we would have happily extended that service.	
3235545	50011433	We stayed there for three nights.		80012096	Chairs are available outside the rooms as well as a lawned area in the front of the motel.	
3235545	50011434	The room was rather dark, but on arrival seemed to be clean.		80012097	We apologise if we did not live up to your expections.	
3235545	50011435	It was relatively quiet .		80012098	We are hoping to commence renovations shortly to upgrade the bathroom and motel in general.	
3235545	50011436	The aircon was quiet and effective.				
3235545	50011437	There was a large gap under the door and the whole place would have welcomed some paint.				
3235545	50011438	The room servicing consisted of changing the towels and emptying the garbage; anything else appeared to be too much bother.				
3235545	50011439	The beds were very uncomfortable.				
3235545	50011440	There was virtually no where outside to sit and enjoy the late afternoon/evening.				
3235545	50011441	Too much concrete and not enough customer focus.				

3243278	50011450	Great stay ---SEP---		80012109	Kitty, We greatly appreciate your loyalty and repeat business and the time you took to tell others.	
3243278	50011451	We are repeat visitors to this hotel.		80012110	We look forward to many future opportunities to have you as our guest again!	
3243278	50011452	It is clean and the rooms are updated and nice although it may look a little dated on the outside.				
3243278	50011453	The breakfast buffet is always plentiful and the service is great.				

3316489	50011460	Front Desk Staff ---SEP---		80012121	Thank you for taking the time to let other travelers know about our hotel and about our area, we really appreciate your feedback.	
3316489	50011461	This is my 5th monthly stay here.		80012122	It is always good to know that our staff is doing right by our guests, I will pass this review to them, I'm sure they will be thrilled.	
3316489	50011462	"Megan & Robert @ the Front Desk Are Superb in handling proper rooms & anything i requested in making my stay enjoyable and because if my IHG ""spire elite"" status they always make sure i get the room upgrade"		80012123	Thanks again and have a great day!	
3316489	50011463	i recommend this property because of location to beaches-shopping-grocery stores-bars-nightclubs & great restaurants as well as to I-95/I595 connecting to other highways!				

3261239	50011470	Excellent stay in New Plymouth ---SEP---		80012134	Thankyou for your most positive review following your stay with us.	
3261239	50011471	We stayed in 16 Northgate Motor Lodge only for one night.		80012135	The spacious super king studios are very quiet with the double glazing windows.	
3261239	50011472	We were planning to trek the Taranaki the next day and come back there also for the second night		80012136	Perhaps the next time you visit New Plymouth you will get to enjoy more outdoors activities.	
3261239	50011473	but it was raining (heavily) so we cancelled our plan and drove on to Wellington.		80012137	We hope to see you again.	
3261239	50011474	Despite that, our brief stay in this motel was really comfortable and we were happy that we found this place.				
3261239	50011475	The girl in the reception was very friendly and helpful and made us very welcome from the first minute.				
3261239	50011476	We got a room closest to the street (that is actually a main artery in New Plymouth) but the noise at night was acutally minimal.				
3261239	50011477	Maybe it was the heavy rain that muffled all other sounds :)				
3261239	50011478	The room itself was very clean and tidy and it seemed also quite new.				
3261239	50011479	Flat screen tv had enough channels and wifi was fast.				
3261239	50011480	As we were on the ground floor, we could park our car right outside our window.				
3261239	50011481	Due to the weather we did not spend much time in the city but there were many shops and some restaurants close by.				
3261239	50011482	All in all a great experience so I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again if ever in New Plymouth.				

3222185	50011490	Comfortable and clean ---SEP---		80012148	Hello Travellingcatcatcat	
3222185	50011491	We stayed here for 2 nights.		80012149	I am glad to hear you enjoyed your stay with ud during your visit to Banff.	
3222185	50011492	The room was comfortable and clean.		80012150	I would like to apologize about the disturbance you had during your second night.	
3222185	50011493	The parking is limited and fills up quickly.		80012151	Most of our standard room are adjoining and this can allow some noise to travel to the adjoining room.	
3222185	50011494	Our first night, we slept very well.		80012152	Thank you, Chris Jonah Bow View Lodge	
3222185	50011495	Our second night, not so much.				
3222185	50011496	We are unsure whether all the rooms are adjoining, however very young twin babies were placed in the room next to us - it was like they were in our room.				
3222185	50011497	Needless to say we didnt sleep particularly well.				
3222185	50011498	We did mention it to the front desk day and they did apologise profusely.				
3222185	50011499	We just couldn understand why they would put twins who would clearly cry all night in the middle of a corridor - Im sure the other rooms were just as disturbed as us.				
3222185	50011500	Other than the poor sound proofing, our stay was a pleasant one.				
3222185	50011501	My one issue however is that there is not free wifi which was offered in every other motel we stayed in.				

3188721	50011510	Front Desk Blues ---SEP--- I stay at lots of Hilton Properties and understand when early check-in is not available but when a reserved room is not available, until two hours after the listed check-in time, it can be very inconvenient.		80012163	Thank you for sharing your review of your time at the Hampton Inn & Suites Denver.	
3188721	50011511	The location of this property is very good and the hotel is well maintained.		80012164	On behalf of our entire team and management staff, I would like to apologize for the poor levels of customer service that you experienced during your stay.	
3188721	50011512	Everyone that I encountered, other than the front desk staff, was very friendly and welcoming.		80012165	This is not the norm for our location and we are sorry that you had such a negative overall impression of our hotel.	
3188721	50011513	I have to believe that the owners are not aware of the childish behavior, on the part of the front desk staff, when they are away.		80012166	Our team is here to service our guests and we take pride in what we do.	
3188721	50011514	I arrived at one o'clock and was immediately told by a young lady, with a mop of hair in her eyes, that check-in was not available until three PM.		80012167	We take poor customer service very seriously and please know that our team has addressed the issues involved to prevent poor service like this from happening to any other guests.	
3188721	50011515	The tone was a bit condescending for someone in the service business and she seemed to be annoyed that I had arrived early.		80012168	While we understand that this will not change your stay from December, feedback like this is essential in providing training, coaching and counseling opportunities for staff members.	
3188721	50011516	I checked my bag and went for a walk, returning around 2:30 PM.		80012169	Thank you again for all the feedback that you provided.	
3188721	50011517	The room was still not ready, so I waited in the lobby / breakfast area.		80012170	We hope that if your travels bring you back to Denver that you will give us the opportunity to serve you again so we can show you the outstanding customer service that you deserve and that we are known for providing.	
3188721	50011518	"During the wait, I observed the housekeeping staff working diligently to get rooms ready, while three front desk staffers joked amongst themselves and with friends who ""dropped by""."				
3188721	50011519	My room was finally ready shortly before five PM.				
3188721	50011520	I asked for the bag that I had checked and handed the staff member my claim tag, only to discover that they had somehow misplaced my bag.				
3188721	50011521	After a few minutes it was located and I headed to my room.				
3188721	50011522	All of this completely without apology or explanation.				
3188721	50011523	One of the housekeeping staff did tell me that there was a sports event in town the night before and that lots of guests had been granted late check-out.				
3188721	50011524	Housekeeping didn't seem to be happy about the situation either.				
3188721	50011525	As an option, I would suggest the Downtown Hilton Garden Inn as a much better choice.				
3188721	50011526	The Downtown Marriott is also very good.				
3188721	50011527	If you don't have to be in the downtown area there are lots of good options around the airport.				
3188721	50011528	I won't take a chance on this place in the future.				
3188721	50011529	I should also mention that a number of other guests were also waiting for rooms and several left, electing to seek other accomodations, rather than wait.				

3289528	50011530	A lovely little hotel ---SEP---		80012181	Dear wright50 Thank you for your review.	
3289528	50011531	The hotel was really lovely, the food was good average 10 pounds for bar meals ie sausage and mash, views are good if u get the right room, although the rooms are very hot at night so ask for a fan at reception.		80012182	I was delighted to read that you enjoyed your recent stay with us at our Limpley Stoke Hotel, your feedback is most welcome and helps us maintain and improve our standards and services for all our guests to enjoy.	
3289528	50011532	Lovely little pub at the end of the hotel bottles of wine 10 pounds food good.		80012183	Thank you for choosing the Limpley Stoke Hotel, we do look forward to welcoming you back again on your next visit to Bath and don't forget to take advantage of visiting the hotel website for our best rate guarantee.	
3289528	50011533	Breakfast in the hotel was good, staff very friendly and ready to help, will defiantly book again on my next visit to bath .		80012184	Kind regards Guest Relations Manager Limpley Stoke Hotel	
3289528	50011534	Just a note it is a popular hotel for weddings so if u book check when booking it didn't cause us any problem				
3289528	50011535	but it's nice to know				

3326979	50011540	Great location, large rooms!		80012195	Dear Nipun S, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community.	
3326979	50011541	---SEP---		80012196	It is our pleasure to accommodate you at Meriton Suites Mascot Central on your recent travels.	
3326979	50011542	First thing we noticed is how easy it was to access.		80012197	We couldn‚Äôt agree with you more that our prime location gives our guests convenient access to and from the Airport, just moments from public transport not to mention shops, cafes and restaurants.	
3326979	50011543	One train stop from the airport, and you're right next to the hotel area.		80012198	We are pleased you were able to make the most of our apartment-style accommodation, each suite with a fully equipped gourmet kitchen and internal laundry.	
3326979	50011544	So it's really easy to get to the centre of the city too.		80012199	Your kind praises about our friendly Guest Services team are appreciated and will be shared with the team, we know they will be delighted.	
3326979	50011545	The area has almost everything you need, a supermarket, salon, a bunch of food places - of which I loved the Japanese restaurant across the road to the station!		80012200	Nipun S, we do look forward to welcoming you back to Meriton Suites in the near future.	
3326979	50011546	Also spas, coffee shops etc.		80012201	Kind regards Todd M Online Reputation Team	
3326979	50011547	The hotel staff were very friendly and we got to the room really quick; and the room was with many surprises, starting with how large it was.				
3326979	50011548	A definite plus point was the washing machine and dryer they had - which made our lives so much easier.				
3326979	50011549	The TV had a great many number of channels and we were watching an interesting movie each night before calling it a night.				
3326979	50011550	The washroom was clean and nice, but without a bidet.				
3326979	50011551	We were able to cook a couple of our meals in the kitchen too, which was also well equipped and clean.				
3326979	50011552	tip: don't forget to get a public transport card from the airport.				
3326979	50011553	Also, if you want to avoid the airport charge via train, take the bus.				
3326979	50011554	But the extra cost is usually negligible considering the extra effort.				

3268658	50011560	Stunning hotel with an amazing view ---SEP---		80012212	Hi Michah_Reynolds, Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.	
3268658	50011561	We stayed here for a night while making a stop in Chicago Wednesday before heading to the upper peninsula of Michigan for a wedding.		80012213	We are unbelievably happy to hear that you had a wonderful time staying at our hotel and that you enjoyed interacting with our staff on our rooftop.	
3268658	50011562	The front desk staff was friendly and helpful on our first visit to Chicago, giving suggestions on sights during our brief time.		80012214	We can't wait to welcome you back to our hotel the next time you are in Chicago.	
3268658	50011563	The room was beautiful, quiet, and had a great view of the river (minus the Trump building).		80012215	Thanks again and safe travels!	
3268658	50011564	Everything was perfect.				
3268658	50011565	One suggestion from the front desk was the rooftop bar on the 22nd floor.				
3268658	50011566	We decided to check it out upon arrival and were bummed to see it closed until noon.				
3268658	50011567	We came back and the views and service beyond made up for the bar being closed when we originally wanted to go.				
3268658	50011568	We were promptly greeted by Tim, who made us feel welcome with his quick and witty banter (apparently he's a standup comic in the city, it showed).				
3268658	50011569	He went over the drinks and suggested his favorites, which we took him up on.				
3268658	50011570	I had an old fashioned, and my wife had the Roaring Twenties.				
3268658	50011571	Both were amazing.				
3268658	50011572	The Old Fashioned had to have been one of the best I've had in a long time.				
3268658	50011573	We had duck fat fries, as well as some sort of cheese bread and a basic salad.				
3268658	50011574	All of them were amazing, and are great for sharing.				
3268658	50011575	The bill was what you'd expect for a downtown rooftop (we're from NYC, so it was actually less than expected), running around 100 for a few drinks each and the food.				
3268658	50011576	Our afternoon at the rooftop at London House will be something we remember for years to come, and will suggest all of our local family visits.				
3268658	50011577	If only Chicago's unpredictable weather didn't cut our visit short, as it started raining shortly after we finished our food.				
3268658	50011578	Overall, our experience at London House was amazing.				
3268658	50011579	Superb service, outstanding accommodations, and incredible views have got us doing something we've never thought of doing before; planning a long weekend vacation to Chicago.				
3268658	50011580	I can guarantee that we will be staying at London House.				

3295770	50011590	Great location ---SEP---		80012226	We are so pleased you enjoyed our location in this great little pocket of Cowes.	
3295770	50011591	Great location near beach and shops quiet and peaceful, cabin had great facilities and clean comfortable beds great stay For couple of days to see all the island has to offer.		80012227	It's ideal for families as well with a safe, calm beach at our doorstep.	
3295770	50011592	Would recommend for families too		80012228	Thank you for posting a positive review and hope you can come and spend some time here again.	

3220770	50011600	Nice Hotel.		80012239	Thank you for your feedback.	
3220770	50011601	Good Price.		80012240	Your review is appreciated.	
3220770	50011602	---SEP---				
3220770	50011603	The Hotel was clean and very comfortable.				
3220770	50011604	Hotel staff, were very accommodating upon check in.				
3220770	50011605	Location was great for the convention centre.				
3220770	50011606	Lots of noise from hotel construction in the morning.				
3220770	50011607	crews were loud with their chatter.				
3220770	50011608	Restaraunt Bar was closed.				
3220770	50011609	which is too bad.				

3166689	50011610	Fabulous place to celebrate a 50th (or any other birthday!)		80012251	Thanks very much.	
3166689	50011611	---SEP---		80012252	Agreed about the house - too much glass!	
3166689	50011612	We had a long weekend at Millar Road in the main house and loved it.		80012253	We are planning some exciting modifications to the house and will be looking to make some changes to the heating as part of that.	
3166689	50011613	Spacious, comfy beds, lovely bathroom products and great breakfast supplies.		80012254	Hope to see you back again.	
3166689	50011614	It's very private and quiet with spectacular views over countryside and the sea.				
3166689	50011615	The property is excellent value.				
3166689	50011616	We found the house a little hard to warm up though the fire is great - we'll be back in summer!				

3312770	50011620	Last year my wife and I went to the Southern Baptist Convention.		80012265	Thank you for taking the time to submit a review and recommend our hotel.	
3312770	50011621	The location and room was excellent.		80012266	J.J. and Caitlin will very much appreciate your comments about their helpfulness.	
3312770	50011622	---SEP---		80012267	Many of our NextGen rooms are quite large in comparison to other hotels.	
3312770	50011623	Our room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.		80012268	I hope you had a chance to use our recently upgraded and much improved Wi-Fi service.	
3312770	50011624	JJ and Caitlin were very helpful.		80012269	It is of course free of charge.	
3312770	50011625	We felt very welcome.		80012270	Please come back for another visit as soon as possible.	
3312770	50011626	They helped us with information we needed.				
3312770	50011627	It was close to the convention center and close to several restaurants.				
3312770	50011628	I definitely recommend this hotel.				

3323688	50011630	Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again ---SEP---		80012281	Dear Guest Thank you for your feedback.	
3323688	50011631	Made our booking online using bookings.com and paid full amount in advance.		80012282	The information about pre-authorization is clearly mentioned in all websites (T&C's page of booking confirmation).	
3323688	50011632	Then on arrival we were asked to pay another $50.		80012283	Although, the room was pre-paid, FO staff request authorization as a part of check-in procedure to cover incidentals.	
3323688	50011633	A bond they called it.		80012284	Thank you.	
3323688	50011634	They already have our credit card details so do not see why this is necessary.		80012285	Have a nice day ahead	
3323688	50011635	It is also not mentioned on bookings.com that this is a requirement.		80012286	Regards KC	
3323688	50011636	Spoke with manager about this.				
3323688	50011637	He 1st said that it was a new requirement and the website had not been updated, but then later admitted that they have been doing this for 3 years!				
3323688	50011638	After all this room had rubbish on floor and mould in shower.				
3323688	50011639	Don‚Äôt stay here if you can avoid it.				

3223864	50011640	Fantastic service and great value ---SEP---		80012297	Dear 6TP2013 Thank you for your review.	
3223864	50011641	We (2A 4C) stayed here for 3 nights on our 2 week NZ trip and this was by far the cheapest of our accommodation but was far better than most other higher priced places we stayed.		80012298	Very funny about our movie choices, I will be walking down to the DVD store down the road and purchase the World's Fastest Indian based on your advice.	
3223864	50011642	We accidentally checked in a day early and was sorted without hassle.		80012299	I do agree with you - this is a must for our collection!	
3223864	50011643	Secure car parking, clean rooms, close to restaurants, beds comfortable, heating quiet and predictable.		80012300	As you have mentioned, we offer great value at our property - clean, great rooms in the downtown CBD at an affordable price in relation to our competition.	
3223864	50011644	Amenities even included the use of a private cinema room which the kids loved and made our stay special.		80012301	We hope to see you on your next visit down South, Take care Ram	
3223864	50011645	While all the staff were good, Tess was outstanding !				
3223864	50011646	recommending using the cinema and taking in popcorn and drinks as well as giving us plenty of tips for our next destination.				
3223864	50011647	If you are looking for 5 star this is not the place for you but if you are looking for a clean practical hotel in a good location it is ideal.				
3223864	50011648	Our only suggestion is that in their movie choices, being in Invercargill they should have The Worlds Fastest Indian !				

3320985	50011650	Horrific experience ---SEP---		80012312	Dear Laura O, Further to your recent negative review of our hotel, which I believe to be a very unfair and untrue statement I have investigated your claims and I have discovered that you were part of a group that stayed for one night and were celebrating a 21st birthday.	
3320985	50011651	My friends and I stayed in this hotel last weekend.		80012313	I wish to note that we welcome all groups that come to stay at our hotel but we do have strict policies for dealing with groups.	
3320985	50011652	From the moment we arrived we were treated with great disrespect.		80012314	All leisure groups are requested to pay a security deposit upon check-in.	
3320985	50011653	The staff and management had appalling attitudes and made our stay very unwelcoming.		80012315	This is to avoid any issues later at night such as noise disturbances and to ensure that all our hotel guests have a pleasant and relaxing stay with us.	
3320985	50011654	I wouldn't recommend this hotel for any groups , young people or even young couples as for they made it clear we were not very welcome Management approached two members from the group too outline their policy in a very threatening manor.		80012316	This deposit is fully refundable upon check-out where no issues arise.	
3320985	50011655	What was supposed to be a very enjoyable trip turned out to be disappointing because of the hotel staff and management.		80012317	This was communicated to you by the Manager on Duty.	
3320985				80012318	I have also learnt that your group expressed a high level of satisfaction at check-out in relation to your night‚Äôs stay with us, the receptionist on duty stated that your group even discussed the details of the great night you all had in Galway City and thanked us for everything.	
3320985				80012319	I am therefore at a complete loss as to why you have written this most disappointing review of our hotel.	
3320985				80012320	If there is anything further you would like to discuss please do not hesitate to contact me directly.	
3320985				80012321	Kind regards, Siobhan Farragher, General Manager.	

3252437	50011660	Nice hotel, handy for the station ---SEP--- Decent, clean Jury's Inn.		80012332	I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the excellent review.	
3252437	50011661	Helpful and polite staff and very handy location, 5 mins walk from the station.		80012333	I am delighted to read that you enjoyed your stay with us and I will ensure your feedback is passed on to the rest of the team.	
3252437	50011662	Was quiet on Monday and Tuesday night we were there but quite likely to be noisier at the weekend.		80012334	We hope to see you again soon on your next visit.	
3252437	50011663	Bar wasn't overly expensive.		80012335	Kind Regards Jonathan Hay Operations Manager	
3252437	50011664	Very nice hotel in a great city and good value for money.				
3252437	50011665	Didn't see a safe in the room, but everything else you would expect was provided.				
3252437	50011666	Only moan was the hard pillows so have to mark down on sleep quality sadly				

3165628	50011670	Third Rate Hotel ---SEP--- Hotel is old and refurbished in an amateurish way.		80012346	Thank You for taking your valuable time to share your feedback.	
3165628	50011671	Most updates do not even rise to handyman standards.		80012347	It is heart broken that you did not had a great experience during your stay.	
3165628	50011672	Visitors should not pay more than $85 per night.		80012348	We are taking your feedback very seriously to make sure all our guests have pleasant experience.	
3165628	50011673	Breakfast was at about that of a lower rate hotel.		80012349	Looks like we really drop ball on that particular room maintenance, Please accept our sincere apology and give us one more chance to show you how hard we work to make sure all our guests have wonderful experience.	
3165628	50011674	Staff was competent, no issues there.		80012350	We really hope we able to get some feedback while you were at hotel for your four day stay and provide you alternatives to make your stay more comfortable.	
3165628				80012351	We also want to assure you we are constantly working on to improve our hotel every day and you will see improvement during your next visit.	
3165628				80012352	Thank You	

3164928	50011680	Great place to stay...superb!		80012363	Dear Daveikin, Thank you for your review of your stay here at Malmaison Leeds.	
3164928	50011681	---SEP--- Stayed the night for my 40th birthday and went for the meal and wine deal.		80012364	We are delighted to see that you had such a great time with us celebrating your 40th birthday and we look forward to welcoming you back to us soon.	
3164928	50011682	The staff were so nice and spoilt us rotten.		80012365	Kind Regards,	
3164928	50011683	Free cocktail... balloons in the room... very thoughtful.				
3164928	50011684	Meal was lovely and very different.				
3164928	50011685	Was great washed down with schooners of moretti.				
3164928	50011686	Staff were superb and a real credit to the place.				
3164928	50011687	Made my birthday very special.üçªcracking				

3299161	50011690	Great Bar Food ---SEP--- Was in Galway yesterday and went into the Menlo for lunch, Menu was marked with a C for Coeliac and it was great, wonderful choice of food and even Gluten Free sandwich available on request.		80012376	Dear Ciaran D Thanks for that great review.	
3299161	50011691	Also great value for money, Special was 6.95 and it was Stew with Veg, taste was like mammy used to make.		80012377	I love the way you identify some of our unique selling points!	
3299161	50011692	Well worth the visit & will be calling again.		80012378	The daily specials are certainly very popular and we also have a great choice of wraps, salads and sandwiches available as well as a full carvery menu and bar menu every day.	
3299161				80012379	We have got a great response to the Gluten Free or Coiliac friendly range of foods we offer .. approx 90% of our menus are gluten free	
3299161				80012380	and we offer GF pancakes and scones for breakfast as well	
3299161				80012381	so if you are planning a visit to stay in Galway we would love to welcome you..	
3299161				80012382	Thanks again for taking the time to post the review, we really appreciate it.	
3299161				80012383	Kind regards from all the team..	

3176919	50011700	Nice place to stay.		80012394	Dear Melissa, Thank you for your review and your recommendation.	
3176919	50011701	---SEP---		80012395	I am glad that our team and our hotel lived up to the reviews and that your stay was enjoyable.	
3176919	50011702	Perfect place to stay after a long day of activities and driving during our road trip.		80012396	We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and hope to see you back soon!	
3176919	50011703	The good reviews helped us pick this place and we were not disappointed.		80012397	-George	
3176919	50011704	The staff was friendly and the hotel was nice and clean and had a Panera Bread right down the street for those of you who also slept through breakfast.		80012398	Sandona, General Manager	

3326332	50011710	What a view!		80012409	Hi SweetieRocky and thanks for your great review.	
3326332	50011711	---SEP---		80012410	We love living in such a gorgeous spot and we are really happy you enjoyed your time here.	
3326332	50011712	We only stayed the night, but either late afternoon or the morning sunrise is a beautiful sight.		80012411	We hope to see you again next time you visit the area.	
3326332	50011713	On the side of the hill overlooking the beaches at Apollo Bay, this Big 4 certainly has the best view of any Big 4 or accommodation that we stayed at during our trip.				
3326332	50011714	A bit more expensive than others, but views and facilities worth it.				
3326332	50011715	The rest of the park very tidy and well kept.				

3212038	50011720	Not great ---SEP---		80012422	Hi Peter, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay.	
3212038	50011721	Spent a week on a powdered dirt site with our van which is now covered with bird droppings.		80012423	We are sorry to hear that we did not meet your expectations during your recent stay with us.	
3212038	50011722	We had booked a site well in advance and got a terrible site.		80012424	We have asked our maintenance team to address your concerns.	
3212038	50011723	Amenities were OK but maintenance of the grounds with dodgy barbecues and limited lighting due to so many blown bulbs.		80012425	We thank you for your feedback and will certainly take your comments on board as we continue to make improvements to our park in the future.	
3212038	50011724	Really enjoyed our stay in Mudgee but will not stay at that park again		80012426	Kind regards, Ingenia Holidays Guest Relations Team	

3283762	50011730	Concerned owner ---SEP---		80012437	Hi Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3283762	50011731	We stayed here one night before a cruise.		80012438	We really appreciate your kind words, and are happy to be of service to you.	
3283762	50011732	Everything in town is $200+ and for one night we decided to stay here.		80012439	Our staff takes pride and goes extra mile to assist guest, we are glad we were able to make your stay comfortable We have recently renovated our entire hotel and glad to hear your stay was comfortable Please stay with us for your next cruise and all the next ones	
3283762	50011733	They had airport pickup that went well and cruise ship transfer ( for a fee) that also went well.		80012440	Thanks and Regards, Management Team Days Inn - Fort Lauderdale	
3283762	50011734	Check in was okay				
3283762	50011735	and we were given a room on the street side.				
3283762	50011736	It is a main thoroughfare so there was a lot of noise.				
3283762	50011737	We left the air conditioning on and it created white noise that helped.				
3283762	50011738	Again, it was only for one night.				
3283762	50011739	On check out day we had an hour before out transfer to the ship terminal and spent some time in the lobby.				
3283762	50011740	The owner came around and talked to people and asked about their stay.				
3283762	50011741	I liked that as it tells me they are making an effort to make changes.				
3283762	50011742	I expresses my opinions and I was assured they were listening.				
3283762	50011743	My opinion of our overall experience is that if you want resort fees and the comfort on a high end property then go with it.				
3283762	50011744	If you want value and somewhere to stay in transit give it a try and keep I;mind it was less that half the price of the other properties.

3230730	50011830	people make a difference ---SEP--- Let me start with I am Hilton Diamond member and stay at their properties every week.		80012556	Thank you so much for your recent 5 star stay!	
3230730	50011831	For the most part, they are very nice properties with service and amenities that fall in line with similar chains.		80012557	We really appreciate guest feedback and you mentioned all the aspects that we focus on for a great stay.	
3230730	50011832	The Embassy Suites Hilton Brandon is unlike any other of the hotels I‚Äôve stayed at in recent memory for one reason: The people.		80012558	It's all due to a great staff, that provide such well-maintained guest rooms and common areas, along with excellent guest service.	
3230730	50011833	I was greeted, checked in and walked to the elevator by Zach at the reception desk.		80012559	We strive to have every guest leave as satisfied as you did.	
3230730	50011834	I noticed the way I was received immediately in the way he took extra care to make me feel welcome.		80012560	Once again, thanks for the great review and staying with us!	
3230730	50011835	That set the tone for the rest of the stay.		80012561	We hope you will visit us again.	
3230730	50011836	The next morning I was immediately greeted by Annie and Diana who welcomed me to breakfast with a smile and warm greeting, not just the standard good morning.				
3230730	50011837	Chef Mike whipped me up an amazing omelet with a smile and the professionalism of executive chef.				
3230730	50011838	Again, it struck me how much each of these individuals cared and genuinely enjoyed what they were doing.				
3230730	50011839	Check out was just pleasurable as Allen repeatedly inquired as to how my stay was and genuinely asked me to return.				
3230730	50011840	People make the difference folks...				
3230730	50011841	These individuals made a weary business traveler feel like he was at 5 star resort with a private staff.				
3230730	50011842	Thank you to all for making this such an enjoyable experience.				

3182285	50011850	Inflexible and uncaring management policy ---SEP---		80012572	Dear Umesh J Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback following your stay.

3182285	50011854	The hotel then choose to increase the rate for the additional night despite me having booked for an entire week and it‚Äôs refusal to credit me for error made by my secretary on the arrival date.

3309627	50011867	If you like German food, try Old Heidelberg, it was excellent.		80012593	Sincerely, David Blevins GM	
3309627	50011868	Our fifth floor room was spacious and immaculate.				
3309627	50011869	It was suggested that we arrive for breakfast before 9am and we had no problem finding a place to sit.				
3309627	50011870	There were many choices for breakfast including make your own waffles.				
3309627	50011871	We signed up for the 11am shuttle and we were on our way to the pier shortly after 11.

3276513	50011883	The location was perfect.

3167728	50011890	New Years Eve stay ---SEP---		80012617	Dear G8672PCangelas Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Village Newcastle.

3266322	50011903	beautiful art deco style property.		80012623	You may be aware that we are in the early stages of relaunching our restaurant.

3182502	50011920	Avoid this hotel even if free ---SEP--- Travel is my business.		80012637	Thank you for providing feedback about your stay in January.	
3182502	50011921	I can allow for many things that may go wrong during a hotel stay		80012638	We want to sincerely apologize for the issues experienced while visiting the Westin Nova Scotian.	
3182502	50011922	but I could never allow for a consistantly bad customer service.		80012639	We take comments like these very seriously and we encourage you to contact our Front Office Manager at 902.421.1000.	
3182502	50011923	Our flight was delayed.		80012640	We wish to discuss your concerns in further detail to ensure similar situations do not occur in the future.	
3182502	50011924	We arrived to the hotel 24 hours later than usual due to a big snow storm that closed many airports .....		80012641	Regards, Guido Kerpel	
3182502	50011925	Needless to say we could not wait to get into a warm shower and comfortable bed.				
3182502	50011926	We were told by a cold front desk employee that we have no reservations.				
3182502	50011927	We showed them the travel agents reservations and their response sorry your reservations were for last night and if you do not show up they are cancelled entirely.				
3182502	50011928	We were surprised and said we were booked for five days and we missed one day				
3182502	50011929	but we still have 4 more reserved and already paid for in advance.				
3182502	50011930	Sorry nothing we can do says the young cold girl at the front sesk.				
3182502	50011931	She offered no suggestions.				
3182502	50011932	I said what can we do.?				
3182502	50011933	Her answer we have the space book the rooms again.				
3182502	50011934	it was for almost 200 dollars a night.				
3182502	50011935	was willing to accept				
3182502	50011936	but I thought maybe the front desk manager would have some helpful ideas.				
3182502	50011937	Big mistake to have bothered the front desk manager.				
3182502	50011938	He was upset that we even bothered him offered nothing but cold and non helpfel comments.				
3182502	50011939	I feel that he cares about his hair and glasses a lot more than he cares about business.				
3182502	50011940	we ended up staying the night and we would never go back even if free.				
3182502	50011941	All the staff that we had encountered at the front desk were cold and impersonal.				
3182502	50011942	They looked to me like they were reading from a script.				
3182502	50011943	The rooms were ok but nothing special.				
3182502	50011944	The view was horrible and the windows were dirty and we found old socks in the corner of the room.				
3182502	50011945	I would have never got mad about the socks if the front desck staff had any warmth or hospitality training in them.				
3182502	50011946	I feel the problem is an attitude problem that stems from the top.				
3182502	50011947	Do yourselves a favour and get rid of the front desk staff from top to bottom.				
3182502	50011948	even the staff on day shift when we checked out were made with the same ingredients as those ones from the night before.				
3182502	50011949	How sad you can have a nice property if you teach the staff the value of ncustomer service.				
3182502	50011950	The rest of the staff in the bar and dining broom as well as the valet were more friendly but far from fine.				
3182502	50011951	I am mvery surprised that westin keeps its name on your property.				
3182502	50011952	you need a lot of training to get close to where you should be.				
3182502	50011953	Avoid this property and stay anywhere else in Halifax.

3297085	50011966	Being new here to the country, we didn‚Äôt realize our windows would have ice on them from the cold, and we were in a hurry to catch a tour at 6am and the front desk person was so kind enough to spray hot water on our windshield!				
3297085	50011967	He even packed us a continental breakfast free of charge for us to take!				
3297085	50011968	You get what you pay for!!

3302421	50011993	The lounge and restaurant are also very good.				
3302421	50011994	The only thing needing of improvement is the pool area.				
3302421	50011995	Not a nice pool and they can do more with the space.				

3163512	50012000	Good Value for the price paid ---SEP--- Stayed at Ibis Budget for 4 nights.		80012694	Thank you for your very kind words.

3163512	50012004	The only problem I found was that the bathroom door had a hole instead of a knob which becomes a bit of a problem while staying with family.

3200541	50012047	Hip, Clean, and Adult oriented.				
3200541	50012048	"I am a business traveller so I travel almost every week to various cities and the Aloft Phoenix staff is always friendly, helpful and always offers me ""something"" complimentary."				
3200541	50012049	The rooms are small but efficient, clean, and high tech with plugs everywhere.				
3200541	50012050	I would recommend it to adult business travelers especially.

3211594	50012080	"amazing hotel ---outstanding customer service ---SEP--- Staying at the Brown Palace was on a ""Bucket List"" so we made it happen this last weekend when on business in Denver, CO."		80012784	Thank you for this raving comment.	
3211594	50012081	We (3) ate at the Palace Arms and it was even better than we imagined.		80012785	I am looking forward to share your experience with the service staff of the Palace Arms tonight.	
3211594	50012082	The service staff is wonderful---helpful, thoughtful, courteous and very knowledgeable about the history of the Brown Palace as well as current details.		80012786	We are looking forward to host you at the Brown Palace Hotel and Spa in the near future.	
3211594				80012787	With Best Regards, Thomas Gutmann	

3167732	50012090	Harry Potter Kings Cross 9.2/3 Platform Magic ---SEP---		80012798	Dear FrankM186346 Thank you for taking the time to make me aware of your experience whilst staying with us at the Mercure Leeds Parkway Hotel.	
3167732	50012091	A huge thank you and this week you demonstrated yet again why we keep returning.		80012799	It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback and I shall be very pleased to share your comments with our team.	
3167732	50012092	Our conference was big, included an exciting style of training that was always going to put your hotel under pressure but we need not have worried you had planned to the smallest detail.		80012800	I am sure that this feedback will serve as an encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services.	
3167732	50012093	All the conference rooms looked superb, the buffet delicious especially the Salmon and I just loved the photos and description by each dish thus helping speed and flow you had thought of everything and never once did either buffet look untidy.		80012801	Kindest regards Stewart Woodeson General Manager	
3167732	50012094	Just Superb !				
3167732	50012095	However Magic possibly Harry Potter 9.3/4 Kings Cross platform style must have been used in the car park because even now I cannot work out how your team managed to welcome and accommodated everyone.				
3167732	50012096	I think someone spent hours planning this!!				
3167732	50012097	Again it‚Äôs all in the detail and planning.				
3167732	50012098	I congratulate and thank you all and there were many who deserve big star badges but my number one is Ernest for his leadership, eye for detail and charisma it was infectious.				

3201910	50012100	Amazing ---SEP---		80012812	Hi there, Thanks for your lovely review.	
3201910	50012101	We came here for my Husband‚Äôs birthday and had a fabulous time.		80012813	Our hangover curing breakfast in bed is always included when booking The Lover's Lair suite direct	
3201910	50012102	The staff were friendly and helpful, brilliant cocktails, delicious breakfast in bed and a bath you could almost swim in!		80012814	and we can't think of a better way to start the morning!	
3201910	50012103	A perfect romantic break away from the kids.		80012815	So glad that you had a lovely stay, we hope your husbands birthday was made memorable at The Pelirocco :)	
3201910	50012104	Will definitely be back.		80012816	We can't wait to see you again!	
3201910				80012817	Ails, Bar Manager	

3227117	50012110	Beautiful Lake Seneca views !		80012828	Thank you very much for your review and for sharing all of your amazing photos on TripAdvisor.	
3227117	50012111	---SEP---		80012829	It‚Äôs great to hear you enjoyed the beautiful view of Seneca Lake and that you received great service from our staff.	
3227117	50012112	This is a very nice hotel located on the edge of Lake Seneca.		80012830	Your nice comments are very encouraging to our team who work very hard to provide a great stay.	
3227117	50012113	The water view rooms allow amazing views & in my opinion worth the additional charge.		80012831	We apologize for the lapse of cleanliness in the shower and appreciate you bringing this to our attention.	
3227117	50012114	I thought this would be a 5 star hotel until I discovered black mold in the shower.		80012832	Your valuable comments will be reviewed with our housekeeping team.	
3227117	50012115	So disappointing to us because everything else here was perfect.		80012833	We hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back!	
3227117	50012116	The staff was helpful & friendly.		80012834	Best Regards, Carolyn Guyer	
3227117	50012117	Our room was 220 had a balcony & 2 queen size beds & very nice except for the mold issue in the shower.				

3314036	50012120	Enjoyed our stay ---SEP---		80012845	Dear lorraine, Thank you for the review and i am glad to see the room was clean and it met your expectations.	
3314036	50012121	We stayed at the Esplanade for 3 nights from the 17th.		80012846	We do like to ensure all communal areas are kept to a high standard and are regularly maintained.	
3314036	50012122	Paid a little extra for the Classic Suite which had jacuzzi bath and sea views.		80012847	I am glad also that the food exceeded your expectations and that you found the menu to meet your palette.	
3314036	50012123	The room was very nice and spotlessly clean.		80012848	Overall thank you for your review once again and we trust you will come and visit us again soon.	
3314036	50012124	Bedlinen was not changed daily but towels were.				
3314036	50012125	Communal areas of the hotel were well maintained and inviting to guests (picture window lounge with views of Fistral beach very relaxing).				
3314036	50012126	The exception to this was the stairwells/corridors where the decor was a bit dated and dark.				
3314036	50012127	Restaurant appeared to have recently been modernised.				
3314036	50012128	We were given a good table with seaviews.				
3314036	50012129	Food was excellent and well above standard				
3314036	50012130	I had expected.				
3314036	50012131	Menu was varied and changed daily.				
3314036	50012132	Good selection of wines which were reasonably priced.				
3314036	50012133	Good hotel with relaxing atmosphere.				
3314036	50012134	Well situated for visiting many of Cornwalls tourist attractions.				

3284360	50012140	Lovely cottage ---SEP---		80012859	Thanks for taking time to write a review.	
3284360	50012141	The 3 of us stayed at one of the 2 cottages that Tara has on her farm.		80012860	My apologies for the gas, although I am glad you mentioned it to me eventually so I could swap the cylinders quickly.	
3284360	50012142	It was nice to check in, she had everything we needed in the house, it was very clean and comfortable for our 2 day stay.		80012861	I now know to keep checking this!	
3284360	50012143	She was lovely to deal with, and you get to walk through the orchard and pick ripe fruits and eat them then and there!				
3284360	50012144	A good experience for most of us living in busy cities.				
3284360	50012145	There is also a feed of animals at 9am everyday which we enjoyed.				
3284360	50012146	The only problem we had was the shower had no hot water, or would keep jumping from hot to cold.				
3284360	50012147	When i spoke to Tara, she realised the gas had run out from the tank, which meant mum had to use the shower outside the cottage.				
3284360	50012148	It was fine given it was our last day.				
3284360	50012149	Overall a good experience!				
3284360	50012150	The drive from hobart was lovely, and the farm is very close to old town Richmond which we really enjoyed as well.				
3284360	50012151	There aren't that many dinner options, so we had to drive 15min to get to the closest Pizza place called Nates.				
3284360	50012152	I must admit the drive was worth it as their gourmet pizzas were amazing!				
3284360	50012153	Make sure you have your dinner sorted as there is nothing close to the farm.				

3216836	50012160	Loved my time here!		80012872	Thank you for taking the time to leave us a feedback.	
3216836	50012161	---SEP---		80012873	We are thrilled to read that you enjoyed your experience here!	
3216836	50012162	I requested for a view room ahead in time and had one when I arrived.		80012874	It is truly amazing to wake up to the mountains, we are fortunate to be located at such a pristine spot!	
3216836	50012163	It was just amazing to wake up to the mountains and nothing beats the view!		80012875	It gives us immense happiness to read that we were able to meet your expectations.	
3216836	50012164	The rooms have been upgraded and have nice comfy beds.		80012876	We hope to have another opportunity to welcome you back in the not too distant future!	
3216836	50012165	Great slide and pool and hotub!		80012877	Thanks & Regards!	
3216836	50012166	The grill was good.				
3216836	50012167	They have an outdoor patio area for dinning that is Beautiful!				
3216836	50012168	Very clean rooms.				
3216836	50012169	Wi-Fi was on and off				
3216836	50012170	but that's understandable since it's a remote location.				
3216836	50012171	Here to enjoy the mountains and not stay hooked on to my device anyway!				
3216836	50012172	So didn't bother me too much.				
3216836	50012173	Staff was wonderful!				

3278937	50012180	It's the little extras......		80012888	Thank you.	
3278937	50012181	---SEP---		80012889	Its gratifying to know that the little things get noticed !.	
3278937	50012182	We have just celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at Huntingdon Stables.		80012890	So glad you enjoyed your Wedding Anniversary.	
3278937	50012183	Well we like to go somewhere really different and get away from it all.		80012891	Come again any time.	
3278937	50012184	No big flash over priced lodges for us, but the accommodation was superb, home from home with everything provided.				
3278937	50012185	We did not want to drive onto Cambridge for dinner so took our own simple meal, sat on the deck and indulged.				
3278937	50012186	Wine, chocolates, fresh fruit was all provided along with very very substantial breakfast provisions.				
3278937	50012187	There was a swimming pool, spa, barbecue for our use.				
3278937	50012188	The gardens were lovely.				
3278937	50012189	"There are two ""stables"" and a loft house for visitors."				
3278937	50012190	The loft is less substantial but we viewed it and thought it delightful.				
3278937	50012191	Our accommodation had separate bedroom, full kitchen, bathroom of course.				
3278937	50012192	The furnishings were of the highest quality and the sheets soft and silky.				
3278937	50012193	Thanks to Carole and Neil for a wonderful stay.				

3273538	50012200	Handicapped Room could be much better ---SEP---		80012902	Thanks very much for sharing your thoughts.	
3273538	50012201	This review only applies to the handicapped room.		80012903	We appreciate your visits and your feedback, we will take it into consideration when planning future renovations.	
3273538	50012202	Staff were notified but obviously could not change the carpet or layout of the room.		80012904	I'm very happy that overall you enjoy your stays here and our great staff!	
3273538	50012203	I broke my ankle and have a non-weight bearing cast.		80012905	We hope to see you again soon and also that your ankle recovers quickly!	
3273538	50012204	When I left Penticton Hospital I needed a handicapped hotel room as I need a wheelchair to get around.				
3273538	50012205	The main hotel room is carpeted and very difficult to move on with the wheelchair.				
3273538	50012206	The bathroom has a wheel in shower which I didn't try.				
3273538	50012207	The door from the main room to the bathroom requires several maneuvers on carpet to get into the bathroom.				
3273538	50012208	Altogether not wheelchair friendly.				
3273538	50012209	The staff are friendly and helpful and remember us as we have returned for medical appointments.				

3291155	50012210	Awesome staycation for my family ---SEP---		80012916	Thank you for your review!	
3291155	50012211	I booked this hotel as I had never stayed here before.		80012917	We are pleased to hear that you and your family had the opportunity to enjoy the Fling and Swing Package.	
3291155	50012212	I paid a total of $185 for 1 night and that included the resort fee, $50 resort credit, and kids eat free under the Swing and Fling package.		80012918	We sincerely apologize that our team wasn‚Äôt serving water before 10am at the pool, and can assure you that your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate manager for review.	
3291155	50012213	It was not the cheapest hotel but it was worth it.		80012919	We hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you and your family back again soon!	
3291155	50012214	The fee also included internet, and parking.				
3291155	50012215	They let me check in early so me and my kids could enjoy the pool.				
3291155	50012216	However I had trouble finding my room as its only accessible from one side of the lobby and there was a real lack of signage pointing people in the right direction.				
3291155	50012217	It took me a couple times to figure out where I was going as the place is huge.				
3291155	50012218	Room and bathroom was nice.				
3291155	50012219	A seperate tub and shower and plenty of room.				
3291155	50012220	The pools were awesome.				
3291155	50012221	There was also a lazy river.				
3291155	50012222	Over by the big pool with a fountain there was also a splash pad.				
3291155	50012223	There is also a slide by the lazy river.				
3291155	50012224	The kids eat free turned out to be a bargain.				
3291155	50012225	Even though I was the only adult and I ordered 1 adult entree, they comped both my kids meals at the StoneGrill both times.				
3291155	50012226	Tuscany was also included in this promo however I was not told I had to make reservations				
3291155	50012227	so Sat night we were unable to eat there so we went to Stonegrill.				
3291155	50012228	I was annoyed at first as Stonegrill menu was pricey, but I ordered a terrific burger/fries and soda, bill came to $20 and both the kids ate at the kids buffett for free.				
3291155	50012229	A dinner tab for 3 of $20 is almost unheard of at a resort.				
3291155	50012230	We also ate breakfast at the Stonegrill again my full buffett was a little pricey at $24 but both my kids ate free				
3291155	50012231	and they had a great selection and an omelette station.				
3291155	50012232	Service was outstanding.				
3291155	50012233	Our fridge in the room did not appear to be working so they sent maintenance up to fix it, it was frozen over.				
3291155	50012234	It was quickly repaired and then we got a follow up phone call to make sure it was fixed.				
3291155	50012235	I lost my key so we went to the front desk Sat night to get a new one and the gentleman there gave my kids 2 cute little stuffed animals.				
3291155	50012236	I have to gripe about something so here is a minor complaint.				
3291155	50012237	We went to the pool Sun morning and it appears they are really short staffed.				
3291155	50012238	People started making their way out to pool about 830am yet no staff handing out water until after 10.				
3291155	50012239	It was incredibly hot and with no beverages by the pool until after 10 seems like they need one person with the water cart earlier than 10.				
3291155	50012240	All in all my kids and I cannot wait to stay there again.				

3214363	50012250	Great Midtown hotel ---SEP--- Loved our 4 night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel in a Junior Suite.		80012920	Hi John, Thank you for taking the time to review us and for remembering those employees that had such a positive impact on your stay.	
3214363	50012251	First big plus, as the name suggests, is that it‚Äôs on Bryant Park which imparts sunlight and space in front of the hotel and gets away from the often claustrophobic nature of high rise streets in NYC (getting a Suite or a park facing room will make the most of the view)		80012921	I couldn't wait to show John and Ricardo your review.	
3214363	50012252	First impressions count after an 8 hour flight from the UK and John the doorman was so welcoming, but check-in was perfunctory and disinterested.		80012922	Ricardo has only been with us for less than a month and has already proven to be an amazing find.	
3214363	50012253	This negative vibe was then rescued by Ricardo who showed us to our room, and who‚Äôs friendly nature set the tone for every other interaction with hotel staff members - all were wonderful with Andrew on the Concierge desk being especially helpful.		80012923	I am very happy that you left with some wonderful birthday memories.	
3214363	50012254	Our Junior Suite was fantastic.		80012924	I was surprised to hear about the desk agent and would love to chat more.	
3214363	50012255	A huge room by NYC hotel standards with minimalist modern decor, high ceilings, big windows and a truly massive bathroom with a deep soaking tub and separate walk in shower (made all the better by knock you over water pressure and Molton Brown toiletries).		80012925	Email me when you can.	
3214363	50012256	A happy birthday cake and balloon in the room was a nice touch and much appreciated.		80012926	All my best, Darren; dsumner@bryantparkhotel.com	
3214363	50012257	We were on the 16th floor and noticed NYC traffic noise the first night but after that it wasn‚Äôt an issue.				
3214363	50012258	Hotel lobby is quite small but the new Moroccan themed Celon bar in the basement is great for cocktails and Tapas.				
3214363	50012259	The Koi Sushi restaurant on the premises is also very good - pricey but worth it.				
3214363	50012260	Both the bar and restaurant get very busy in the evenings with city office workers, especially at weekends, so you need to reserve a table.				
3214363	50012261	Overall we really rated this hotel and preferred it to the nearby, pricier Archer Hotel that we stayed at on our last visit.				

3217214	50012270	Great Hotel Despite its Size ---SEP---		80012937	Dear Chelsea33, Thank you kindly for sharing your great review.	
3217214	50012271	We stayed here for 2 nights in March for vacation and used our starwood points.		80012938	I am delighted that you chose to spend March break with us and had a great time.	
3217214	50012272	The hotel is huge but the service was very good.		80012939	I hope you did take advantage of our special March break activities and hope to welcome you back this summer - when the construction on Queen's Quay will be done, so that you can truly appreciate Toronto's waterfront.	
3217214	50012273	We requested a room on a high a nice view and got a nice view overlooking the water.		80012940	Stay well, Edwin Frizzell General Manager	
3217214	50012274	Very pretty.				
3217214	50012275	Nice location right by the harbor but lots of construction all around.				
3217214	50012276	The pool is very large but very popular.				
3217214	50012277	I would definitely recommend this hotel.				

3185113	50012280	Wonderful stay!!		80012951	Dear Steve and Lori, Thank you for your wonderful review!

3185113	50012283	The accommodations are top notch and they have thought of everything.		80012954	Warm regards, Jade, Jay and Team	
3185113	50012284	The breakfast is wonderful and the canap√©s and drinks in the early evening are a treat.				
3185113	50012285	All the staff are delightful and helpful with local attractions and dining.				
3185113	50012286	Definitely recommend!				

3172357	50012290	Great location and excellent breakfast ---SEP--- Very comfortable room and exceptionally clean, with tea and coffee making facilities and a cheese board and knife, which is a nice touch.		80012965	Many thanks for your review we are pleased you enjoyed your stay with us.

3172357	50012292	The host was very friendly and greeted us on arrival.		80012967	Glad you found the excellent location of the guesthouse to be in easy walk to the town centre and the jetty.	
3172357	50012293	Great continental breakfast with everything you could want.		80012968	We truly appreciate our guests taking time out in their busy lives to write a review.	
3172357	50012294	Very close to the jetty and local restaurants.		80012969	Thanks once again and looking forward to seeing you again.	
3172357	50012295	On site secure parking We will be back.		80012970	Best wishes Mike and Lorraine	

3205422	50012300	Our 3 night stay in the Wineport Lodge could not have been better ---SEP---		80012981	Dear Stephen31, Thank you for your recent popsting on Trip Advisor.	
3205422	50012301	We had our wedding reception in the Wineport in 2007.		80012982	We were delighted that you enjoyed our stay with us here at The Wineport Lodge.	
3205422	50012302	We decided to make our long overdue return at the weekend for a 3 night stay.		80012983	We have passed on your great comments to our colleagues throughout the hotel.	
3205422	50012303	We drove down from Dublin on Friday evening and arrived around 9pm to find we had been upgraded to the same room we stayed in on our wedding night.		80012984	We do hope to get the opportunity to welcome you back very soon.	
3205422	50012304	It was pure luxury with the most amazing view of the lake.		80012985	Warmest Regards, Ray Byrne & Jane English	
3205422	50012305	The service we received over the 3 days was second to none.				
3205422	50012306	They made us feel so special.				
3205422	50012307	We had our dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night - Duck Confit / Indian selection for starters and Fillet steaks for the main course.				
3205422	50012308	The food and the service were both excellent.				
3205422	50012309	The weekend was not cheap (for us) but it was worth every cent.				
3205422	50012310	We both enjoy going on weekends away and we cannot think of a nicer place to stay.				
3205422	50012311	We wont leave it so long the next time.				

3280329	50012320	Awesome secluded stay ---SEP--- Perfect oasis, gorgeous drive in and views from the lodge.		80012996	Samantha H, we appreciate your review of Red Cliffs Lodge.	
3280329	50012321	Dinner is great onsite, but pricey.		80012997	It's great to hear that you enjoyed your visit and we hope to have you stay with us again in the future!	
3280329	50012322	There is hardly any cell service and the wifi does not work well, but that's ok since you're on vacation.		80012998	Best Wishes, R. Graham - Online Rep - Red Cliffs Lodge	
3280329	50012323	The horses are very friendly and you get free cookies!				

3214460	50012330	Great location ---SEP---		80013009	Dear Nicol S Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.	
3214460	50012331	We stayed 1 night for NYE, great location for city centre, (less than 5 mins walk to thermae bath spa and main shopping area) staff very friendly, helpful and obliging.		80013010	I am so pleased you enjoyed your new years stay with us and that you felt the team looked after you!	
3214460	50012332	Tea coffee selection was good.		80013011	As you have mentioned with the valet service - it is ¬£30 however it is best to prebook as it gets booked up quick!	
3214460	50012333	Lovely elemis products in the bathroom, nice big bath and big shower too.		80013012	We do hope to welcome you back to the hotel again soon Kindest regards Freya Cunningham Assistant Front Office Manager	
3214460	50012334	very comfortable nights sleep!				
3214460	50012335	We were able to use the pool/sauna after check out which was very nice.				
3214460	50012336	¬£30 to use the valet parking for 24 hours we were lucky as didn't book this service and only limited spaces available, would use this service again (Charlotte street car park a short walk away, but nice not to have to cart luggage around plus the hotel is a bit more flexible with the time limit)				

3196559	50012340	Terrific Location and Good Service ---SEP---		80013023	Dear YiiYng, Thank you for your loyal custom and for your kind review of The Westbury Hotel on Tripadvisor.	
3196559	50012341	You could not ask for a better located hotel.		80013024	I am delighted to read that you had a most enjoyable stay on this occasion and that you have chosen to stay with us again and again.	
3196559	50012342	Good service and nice decor.		80013025	The Westbury Hotel has a wide range of rooms, executive rooms and suites which are always worth considering simply because of the sheer quality of the interior decoration, the hotel's location and the impeccable service which we provide.	
3196559	50012343	Rooms sometimes vary in standard.		80013026	Also keep in mind that through the hotel's loyalty programme, The Global Hotel Alliance, it is sometimes possible to avail of a complimentary upgrade based on your frequency as one of our guests and of course on availability.	
3196559	50012344	They are all good but some are better than others.		80013027	I look forward to having the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future.	
3196559	50012345	I like the third floor.		80013028	Thank you once again.	
3196559	50012346	Great toiletries		80013029	Kind regards, Joseph Downing Guest Relations Manager	

3252497	50012350	Accommodation ---SEP---		80013030	It is nice to know that our guests are as pleased with our renovated apartments as we are.	
3252497	50012351	We stayed in one of the recently renovated apartments and everything was brand new.		80013031	Only a couple have been completed, but another 4 are currently gutted and the refurbishment is well underway.	
3252497	50012352	Our location was excellent.		80013032	Once completed, all of the 2 bedroom townhouses will have new kitchens and bathrooms and there will be washer/dryers and dishwashers.	
3252497	50012353	Staff were amazing and friendly.		80013033	The 4 courtyard 1 bedroom apartments will get a similar treatment.	
3252497	50012354	We were in a very quiet spot.		80013034	We have photos that show how amazing they are, but can't post them online until all is completed.	
3252497	50012355	Car park was off the street and safe.		80013035	Thank you for taking the time to comment.	
3252497	50012356	The location is very close to town.				
3252497	50012357	Walking distance to Hannan Street and all the various cafe's and restaurants.				
3252497	50012358	I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking at travelling to Kalgoorlie in the future.				

3229172	50012360	The perfect family holiday ---SEP---		80013046	Thank you Sarah J for your review!	
3229172	50012361	We recently visited big 4 adventure whitsunday and had the most amazing time.		80013047	Our Poolview Condos which you stayed in have one of the best positions in the resort with our new waterslide park directly opposite, so glad you enjoyed your stay so much in them.	
3229172	50012362	We stayed in the 3 bedroom cabin which was very clean and spacious.		80013048	Thank you also for your lovely comments regarding the friendly staff, facilities and gardens, we will pass these on to the team.	
3229172	50012363	We were located right near the water park so easy access to go over to the pool.		80013049	Looking forward to welcoming you back soon for another special holiday :)	
3229172	50012364	Very friendly staff and great facilities, the gardens were also extremely well maintained!				
3229172	50012365	We will be back!				

3254640	50012370	Unique property with great service ---SEP---		80013050	Hi bmiller 2020, Thank you so much for the amazing review.	
3254640	50012371	The hotel was amazing.		80013051	I agree the service is great food at The Corner Office is excellent	
3254640	50012372	Great service.		80013052	so thank you for acknowedging that.	
3254640	50012373	The food was excellent.		80013053	We hope that heartbeat comes sooner than later, see you than!!	
3254640	50012374	Great location in downtown, only a block from the 16th St mall and close to LODO.		80013054	Stay Happy!	
3254640	50012375	The room was great - love the unique feel of the hotel and each floor having a theme.				
3254640	50012376	I would stay again in a heartbeat.				

3291717	50012380	Poor ---SEP--- Looked ok from the outside, inside the musty,mildew smell was overwhelming..		80013065	Thank you for your comments and I‚Äôm sorry we were less than you expected.	
3291717	50012381	Thankfully we only had 1 night there, and left as soon as it was light.		80013066	If you are ever unhappy or unsatisfied, I would urge you to contact the front desk as our goal is for you to leave satisfied and pleased.	
3291717	50012382	Everything was spread out in 3 different buildings..		80013067	We wish you safe travels and thank you for visiting Branson.	
3291717	50012383	Staff seemed very unorganized..		80013068	Sincerely, Jay Wilson General Manager	
3291717	50012384	We have had many trips to Branson and just thought we would give this a try on our last night there.. now we know.. never again......				

3276454	50012390	Good choice in downtown Moncton ---SEP---		80013079	Thank you for your review on your recent stay with us!	
3276454	50012391	This is a newer Residence Inn, and a notch above other Residence Inn's I've stayed in.		80013080	We are happy to hear you enjoyed our hotel, location and rooms.	
3276454	50012392	They offer the typical roomy Residence Inn studios and suites with every amenity required.		80013081	We have a salt water pool at the hotel and do not use chlorine.	
3276454	50012393	Of note was how quiet the room was.		80013082	We apologize for the chemical smell as the pool deck was being cleaned at that time.	
3276454	50012394	Even though it's downtown, and even though there were rooms full of celebrating grads down the hall, I heard nothing.		80013083	We hope that next time you will be able to enjoy our pool.	
3276454	50012395	It must be well built with extra thick walls or soundproofing.		80013084	We appreciate the recommendation and we hope to see you back again soon.	
3276454	50012396	A very peaceful and restful sleep in the most comfortable of beds.		80013085	Warm Regards, Darlene Power	
3276454	50012397	The staff is helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast offers lots of variety.				
3276454	50012398	They have one free computer to use in the lobby.				
3276454	50012399	I did not use the pool, but it looked clean.				
3276454	50012400	I expect though that it may be over-chlorinated as the smell was powerful.				
3276454	50012401	Parking is $12.00/night for hotel guests, with in and out privileges.				
3276454	50012402	Make sure you have the front desk validate your parking stub, and retrieve it from the machine every time you exit.				
3276454	50012403	Compared to its nearby competition - the Delta and Rodd - I certainly recommend the Residence Inn.				

3316406	50012410	Staff friendly, the rest not to recommend ---SEP---		80013096	As you mentioned, we have been renovating the hallways and just just the 5th floor but all of them.	
3316406	50012411	We had a warm welcome at the Ocean Sky and got rooms 908 and 910 with a connecting door.		80013097	We also have many plans in the near future.	
3316406	50012412	The door has not been used for a while, and has been paintet in the meantime that the color sticked the door to the wall....		80013098	We hope that you give us another opportunity soon.	
3316406	50012413	After we opened it, you can imagine how dirty it was in between these two doors.		80013099	Thank you.	
3316406	50012414	One of the fridges was full of melted ice and so we called the front desk.		80013100	Paul Cahaly General Manager	
3316406	50012415	A friendly room maid came immediately and cleaned the old carpet.				
3316406	50012416	As we had another fridge in the second room, it was not that bad that the dirty fridge stayed dirty until our departure.				
3316406	50012417	The balconies were very clean and the chairs comfortable.				
3316406	50012418	The view is great ‚Äì also during the night with the ocean on one and the lights of the city on the other side.				
3316406	50012419	The pool was nice and the area more or less clean.				
3316406	50012420	When we arrived there by 5 pm, we 6 were happy, cause we got the last 3 pool towels.				
3316406	50012421	The lady at the poolbar could not organize more towels cause she was not in charge.				
3316406	50012422	Opening hours oft he pool: 7.am to 11 pm.				
3316406	50012423	On a normal thursday no towels for the pool for more than a third of the whole opening time.				
3316406	50012424	Well, so we did not have to try the pool bar ‚Äì maybe the lady would also not be in charge.				
3316406	50012425	The old shower next to the pool was fun.				
3316406	50012426	We did not know that something like that still exists.				
3316406	50012427	There is an elevator directly from the pool deck to the rooms.				
3316406	50012428	This elevator was not working during our whole stay.				
3316406	50012429	Like this, we had to walk through the lobby with furniture of the fifties.				
3316406	50012430	A few more years and they will be modern again.				
3316406	50012431	Parking costs $12 per night which is a moderate prize.				
3316406	50012432	And what we really appreciate is the free WiFi.				
3316406	50012433	This is a service we think is great.				
3316406	50012434	What will await you in room 910: Aircondition is very old and loud but works.				
3316406	50012435	Not too confortable when you want to sit on the chair when it‚Äôs hot, cause the aircondition will blow warm air in your neck.				
3316406	50012436	2 Lamps by the bed: are dirty but they work.				
3316406	50012437	Water in the bathroom:				
3316406	50012438	There is one way to stop the water: Bring it to one special position and try hard and you will manage that the water will not run the whole night.				
3316406	50012439	On the Hotel Information Manual you will find half of a chocolate bar on the second page.				
3316406	50012440	It looks like the room maids haven‚Äôt looked at it for a while ‚Äì so maybe you‚Äôll find it.				
3316406	50012441	Opening the balcony‚Äôs door is another challenge, but you will manage ‚Äì as we did.				
3316406	50012442	What you will find in room 908:				
3316406	50012443	The lamp standing next tot he window does not work.				
3316406	50012444	The same lamp as in the other room but luckily in the other room there was a button to bring it to work.				
3316406	50012445	We shouldn't have used the 3 coffee portions the first day, cause they haven't been refilled the coming day.				
3316406	50012446	On the 5th floor we once saw workers come into the elevator.				
3316406	50012447	It seems like there are a few things they renew.				
3316406	50012448	So I would suggest if you still are thinking of going to that hotel, maybe you could ask for a room on a floor that has been renewed.				
3316406	50012449	If the rooms would be as nice as the staff at the valet parking, front desk, concierge are friendly, it would be a lovely place.				
3316406	50012450	"Why it's called ""Resort"" is another question...."				
3316406	50012451	With the check-out we mentioned that we did not like it there at all.				
3316406	50012452	The lady at the front desk was very sorry and told me to tell it the room service manager too...				
3316406	50012453	The problem of a bad condition of the rooms can unfortunately not be solved by only a room service manager...				

3326663	50012460	Our first stay here.		80013111	Thanks for the great review Graham and Janet.	
3326663	50012461	But, not our last.		80013112	It was lovely to have 'Whitby regulars' stay!	
3326663	50012462	---SEP---		80013113	Hope you see you again soon.	
3326663	50012463	From the ease of booking, through to check out, everything was 100%.				
3326663	50012464	Phill and Sophie are a wonderful couple, very welcoming and helpful.				
3326663	50012465	We stayed in the luxury room, on the top floor.				
3326663	50012466	The room very clean and well appointed, with a very nice bathroom.				
3326663	50012467	The breakfast is a standard choice, with a daily special, and the quality of the ingredients was first class.				

3176764	50012470	Relaxing stay ---SEP---		80013124	Dear kris091, Thank you very much for your feedback (particulalry on the menu offerings) and for taking the time to let us know how you felt.	
3176764	50012471	We just got back from a week long holiday at Peppers Palm Cove.		80013125	On some occasions when the weather chops and changes we do find it challenging from time to time to maintain the appropriate staff on duty to serve.	
3176764	50012472	Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best and we had several rainy days however what begins as a rainy day in Palm Cove can then turn into a beautiful sunny day a few hours later!		80013126	We are working on improving this aspect of our service.	
3176764	50012473	Obviously this isn't the fault of Peppers and they had plenty of umbrellas on hand when needed.		80013127	Chef is releasing a new menu on July 1 and we have also completely renovated the kichen and bar which is due to re-open on June 25.	
3176764	50012474	We had a 2 bedroom ocean front suite that we shared with my parents which was great and offered maximum privacy for each group.		80013128	Kind regards, Chris & team	
3176764	50012475	The king size beds and pillows were really comfortable and the sound of the ocean waves crashing was beautiful to listen to.				
3176764	50012476	The rooms were clean and serviced daily which is great coming back to a clean and tidy room.				
3176764	50012477	I was a little disappointed with the room service menu though.				
3176764	50012478	There were a couple of times we just felt like something simple to eat like a toasted sandwich or club sandwich but the room service menu is from the restaurant Lime and Pepper which I felt had limited options.				
3176764	50012479	I ended up having the gourmet beef burger one night which was just ok.				
3176764	50012480	I also felt like a dessert on another occasion but they sounded quite unappetising (pumpkin pudding with pineapple or plum mousse with sweet curry sauce).				
3176764	50012481	However I didn't call and ask if I could get something more simple so maybe there is more available if you ask?				
3176764	50012482	But Palm Cove has an amazing selection of restaurants, Vivo Bar and Grill was our absolute favourite and Il Forno Pizzeria was also great fun.				
3176764	50012483	The main pool at Peppers is amazing and was the main reason we booked to stay there as we were all keen on sitting around the gorgeous pool and swimming.				
3176764	50012484	I read somewhere that it was one of the only hotels in Palm Cove that had a heated swimming pool.				
3176764	50012485	However none of the pools were heated and they were all really really cold!				
3176764	50012486	We had one great sunny day that we all sat around the pool and swam however I could only get in for a very short time and didn't want to brave it again.				
3176764	50012487	I had to get my son out when his lips turned blue!				
3176764	50012488	We all had a swim but would have loved the water to have been a few degrees warmer so we were more comfortable.				
3176764	50012489	I left the main pool at one stage to go and get in the spa to get warm but it too was freezing, how strange.				
3176764	50012490	Another issue was the pool bar.				
3176764	50012491	A gentleman waiting behind me at one stage called it a debacle and I would have to agree.				
3176764	50012492	We were so disappointed that they didn't come around and take your drink and food orders around the pool, instead you had to go up to the bar and wait, order and wait again 15 to 20 mins for your cocktails and then carry them back on a tray which just didn't seem to be a 5 star way of doing things and ended up being a real pain and put a lot of pressure on the bar staff who were busy making cocktails whilst an irritated line of people watched on.				
3176764	50012493	However you can order food at the bar and they will bring it out to you, make sure you get the bucket of chips, they are in a huge bucket and were really yummy but again would have loved to see some more simple snack items on the menu that weren't deep fried like chicken or ham sandwich.				
3176764	50012494	After indulging at each breakfast and dinner sometimes you feel like something light for lunch or afternoon snack by the pool.				
3176764	50012495	We all thought the breakfast, which was included in our package, was great.				
3176764	50012496	A lot of variety and really yummy way to start the day.				
3176764	50012497	We didn't end up using the free wifi as it was pretty slow.				
3176764	50012498	The staff were all friendly and helpful when asked.				
3176764	50012499	My husband and I had a massage at the day spa which was lovely but pretty expensive and the hard sell of their products at the end turned me right off.				
3176764	50012500	Overall we had a really relaxing and fun holiday and were happy with the accommodation and service.				

3176623	50012510	Great stay ---SEP---		80013139	Hi barahsuxton, thank you for the review of your stay here at Cambridge City East.	
3176623	50012511	Even though we had some preconceptions about the Premier Inn we were pleasantly surprised at our stay.		80013140	We are so pleased to hear that you thought the beds were comfy, and rooms a decent size.	
3176623	50012512	The rooms were decently sized and the beds were superbly comfy!		80013141	It is our aim to make our guests feel brilliant through a great nights sleep!	
3176623	50012513	(In fact, I had the best sleep of my trip here despite stay at more expensive hotels).		80013142	Kind regards, Premier Inn Team	
3176623	50012514	The hotel is in a good location and is in walking distance of the various colleges.				
3176623	50012515	The breakfast was yummy but nothing to rave about however despite this it was still an excellent stay.				

3168961	50012520	Best Hotel in Downtown Indianapolis ---SEP---		80013153	Thank you for taking the time to write a review.	
3168961	50012521	While there are several high-end hotel options (e.g., Omni, Le Meridien, JW Marriot) in the area that are centrally located, the Conrad is by far the most luxurious.		80013154	We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay with us.	
3168961	50012522	This was our first time at a Conrad and we were definitely impressed.		80013155	We are truly proud of our wonderful staff and well-appointed property, and I am elated to hear that we will be your preferred choice in Indy!	
3168961	50012523	While it is a notch below popular luxury brands such as the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Park Hyatt, it's probably most akin to the JW Marriot brand.		80013156	Sincerely, Greg Tinsley General Manager, Conrad Indianapolis 317 713 5000 greg.tinsley@conradhotels.com	
3168961	50012524	Despite the modest cost, we'd recommend valet parking upon arrival.				
3168961	50012525	It's fast, easy and convenient.				
3168961	50012526	A common theme throughout our brief stay was fantastic service.				
3168961	50012527	The hotel staff bends over backwards to ensure you're taken care of.				
3168961	50012528	From check-in and room service to mapping your day and dinner reservations, everything is professionally handled.				
3168961	50012529	The rooms are great...fully stocked and very comfortable.				
3168961	50012530	Do not miss dinner or breakfast at the Capitol Grille.				
3168961	50012531	Food is incredible.				
3168961	50012532	Overall, you will not be disappointed.				
3168961	50012533	The Conrad will definitely be our preferred choice on our next trip to Indianapolis.				

3257488	50012540	Good size 2 Queen Room with a balcony ---SEP---		80013167	Dear Guest, We here at the hotel would like to thank you for writing a review on trip advisor.	
3257488	50012541	This room comfortably fit 2 of us along with our 2 bicycles and portable refrigerated cooler.		80013168	We are most pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.	
3257488	50012542	(There was also a fridge in the room).		80013169	If there is anything you would like to add or any questions we are here to help to the best of our ability.\ Sincerely, The team here at best western	
3257488	50012543	The curtains in our particular room could have been a couple of inches longer to block the light but not too bad really.				
3257488	50012544	We ate at the hotel restaurant twice.				
3257488	50012545	Food was good and cost reasonable.				
3257488	50012546	I would go back if ever passing through Osoyoos again.				
3257488	50012547	Derek at the front desk was very helpful.				

3196616	50012550	Fabulous value, service, ammenities and location ---SEP---		80013170	Dear thelaundryfairy, Thank you so much for writing us such a glowing review!

3173717	50012560	Interesting enigma ---SEP---		80013185	Carol A, Thank you very much for coming to visit us once again at The Jacquard Hotel and Rooftop!	
3173717	50012561	My husband and I visit Denver often as our son goes to Denver Uni.		80013186	It was a pleasure hosting you as always.	
3173717	50012562	Howver, this time we visited after I injured myself skiing in Vail.		80013187	We are glad to hear you were able to enjoy some of the great offerings at the hotel to include our restaurant Narrative and the Vero water filling stations.	
3173717	50012563	We tried the Jacquard due to its great location in Cherry Creek.		80013188	As for the troubles you encountered concerning odor and warm water in the commode.	
3173717	50012564	No complaints there with walking distance to the best shopping and restaurants.		80013189	We have worked to rectify both of these issues.	
3173717	50012565	Hotel beds were very comfortable, breakfasts in their Restaurant wonderful.		80013190	However, I would like to sincerely apologize for these problems.	
3173717	50012566	Lovely contemporary feel and quiet rooms.		80013191	In the future, we hope you will decide to visit with us again so we can provide a more comfortable, tailored experience.	
3173717	50012567	The refill drinking water on our floor was appreciated.		80013192	Please, feel free to contact the hotel at any time.	
3173717	50012568	Staff were friendly and courteous.		80013193	303.515.2000 All the best and safe travels!	
3173717	50012569	So all good -		80013194	Sincerely,	
3173717	50012570	BUT from the moment we entered our room on the fifth floor we noticed a bad smell - as if someone forgot to flush the toilet or perhaps even gas from fridge.				
3173717	50012571	We checked and all fine.				
3173717	50012572	Told reception who said they would get housekeeping to check it while we were out.				
3173717	50012573	My son had stayed in the room and said no one showed up.				
3173717	50012574	We found if we closed the toilet lid and bathroom door we could control the smell but ideally we should have changed rooms.				
3173717	50012575	Over four days we noticed the same smell also in a lift and other guests also noticed it.				
3173717	50012576	Then we realized the water in the toilet was going warm - which came to our attention because we left the lid down.				
3173717	50012577	So when we lifted it there was heat.				
3173717	50012578	I used to work in hospitality and noticed the engineer in the lift once so brought it to his attention.				
3173717	50012579	Was still not fixed while we were there and no one offered to move us or checked in with us about the complaint.				
3173717	50012580	Very disappointing.				
3173717	50012581	I got the feeling that the problem is well known by Hotel staff and it‚Äôs a nasty one at that.				
3173717	50012582	Strangest thing ever and definitely coming from the clean toilet water - perhaps it is something in the pipes?!				
3173717	50012583	I hope it is just teething problems but will avoid this Hotel for a while in the hope it will get sorted.				
3173717	50012584	Weird!				

3311587	50012590	Comfortable friendly and wconomical ---SEP---		80013205	Dear George, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel the Amora Hotel Riverwalk Melbourne after your recent stay.

3275154	50012614	We had the most amazing beautiful suite I have ever had in Phoenix.		80013240	It will be our pleasure to welcome you back to our hotel in the future when your travels bring you to Phoenix.	
3275154	50012615	The price was amazing.		80013241	We recommend you giving us a call for the best deals and rates at 602.438.8688.	
3275154	50012616	I really appreciate the very clean room.				
3275154	50012617	Nice bed beautiful view!!				
3275154	50012618	Breakfast was great!				
3275154	50012619	Those cookie you have at the front desk are delicious!!				
3275154	50012620	Vicki and Tom totally bonded over the fabulous oatmeal raisin.				
3275154	50012621	She gave us a Togo bag of cookies shhhhhhh.				
3275154	50012622	Being over the road truck drivers is a lonely life.				
3275154	50012623	We are constantly on the move .				
3275154	50012624	At the moment we do not have a home but South Phoenix has been our home for the last 5 years.				
3275154	50012625	Your staff has constantly made an extraordinary effort to care for our needs,and make our stay comfortable, peaceful, and relaxing.				
3275154	50012626	Weather it was the kind hearted Vicki or the fun loving Jay always ready to refill my wine glass or bring us an extra pillow, It was a consistent theme with every staff member.				
3275154	50012627	They really do care about their guest.				
3275154	50012628	I travel all over the country, this hotel in Phoenix AZ has set my new standard!!				
3275154	50012629	I will always stay here first in Phoenix and when I go to another city and state I will look for GreenTree inn brands first.				
3275154	50012630	We had many friends visit us over the last two stays.				
3275154	50012631	They were all impressed with the beautiful comfort of your hotel.				
3275154	50012632	Your staff even handles problems swiftly, professionally and with our best interests first.				
3275154	50012633	Why other brands can not do this I don‚Äôt understand.				
3275154	50012634	Your staff makes it seem effortless.				
3275154	50012635	I think Vicki and Jay are the hardest working individuals I have meet in years.				
3275154	50012636	Please continue doing what you are doing.				
3275154	50012637	We will see you Friday Through Sunday this week.				
3275154	50012638	I am so looking forward to being back at OUR new home away from home.

3222013	50012681	This is my family's fifth visit to Aqua having stayed in the 4 bedroom single storey villas and, more recently, the double storey villas at the front of the property.		80013284	We are so pleased to announce that we were just awarded the Hall Of Fame for 2018 for our consistent wins of the Certificate of Excellence!

3233447	50012701	The restaurant is also ok - simple food, nothing spectacular.		80013312	I am pleased to read that you found our location convenient for your recent stay.	
3233447	50012702	Overall, it is a very good solution if you have an early morning flight due to its position.		80013313	Kind Regards, Amy	

3229502	50012710	2 week business stay ---SEP---		80013324	Dear Amanda M, Thank you for the wonderful remarks for our staff.	
3229502	50012711	Brittany and Carlos both provided excellent customer service!		80013325	Brittany and Carlos are definitely an asset to our team.	
3229502	50012712	They were very friendly and made my stay very enjoyable.		80013326	They will be thrilled to know that they made your stay more enjoyable.	
3229502	50012713	I enjoyed the pool everyday I was there.		80013327	Our Coast Restaurant does an amazing job and I am so happy that you enjoyed your dining experience.	
3229502	50012714	The restaurant had excellent food, especially the carb cakes!		80013328	I hope that you will visit us again soon.	
3229502	50012715	However, breakfast was a little pricy.		80013329	Silvana G. - Guest Service Manager	

3223771	50012720	Best 5 days in my life ---SEP---		80013330	Hey Linnr742!	
3223771	50012721	I went on the camp with a friend and left the camp with like 10 new friends.		80013331	Thank you so much for your awesome review!	
3223771	50012722	Everyone there is super friendly so even if you are travelling alone..it won't matter when you get there.		80013332	Meeting great new people is one of the most important things and we are happy that we were able to become one of yours.	
3223771	50012723	And a big plus is the instructors, very friendly and good looking.		80013333	Hope to see you again to chill out together.	
3223771				80013334	We hire our intructors only if they are TERRIFIC!	
3223771				80013335	If you haven‚Äôt already, don‚Äôt forget to collect your free tee and hat at the Rip Curl Store in Market Street!	
3223771				80013336	Cheers mate!	
3223771				80013337	Surf Camp Staff	

3269314	50012730	Clean, Honest Accommodation ---SEP---		80013348	Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.	
3269314	50012731	The package we had was just right for our stay in Adelaide.		80013349	I'm glad you enjoyed all the value adds.	
3269314	50012732	Location, location, location close to beach, Tram to CBD, shopping and airport.		80013350	We have plans for the refurbishment of the foyer and other public areas which we are excited to see roll out.	
3269314	50012733	Although tired and the foyer was really sad and off putting the staff were friendly and efficient.				
3269314	50012734	The rooms had been refitted and were clean and the bed was comfy.				
3269314	50012735	Included in the price was a continental breakfast which was enough to get you started for the day.				
3269314	50012736	Views from the upper rooms were great and worth the extra cost.				
3269314	50012737	Parking was free next door to guests with a very short walk to front door.				
3269314	50012738	Hooray!				
3269314	50012739	the wifi was free and works not like some places.				
3269314	50012740	Across the road was a fantastic Buffet that is a must for those who like a value meal and if you need a treat the Orange Spot Bakery next to the hotel is dangerous to weight watchers.				
3269314	50012741	Will use this hotel again as it represents value for money.				

3168994	50012750	Another Excellent Stay ---SEP---		80013361	Dear The Dude Enfield, Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Imperial Hotel.	
3168994	50012751	My wife and i stayed here as we were meeting friends in Cork.		80013362	We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and thank you for taking the time to write such favourable comments on trip advisor.	
3168994	50012752	We went to the reception at around 11am to see if we could leave our luggage but the room was ready for us, which was excellent.		80013363	We look forward to welcoming back to the Imperial Hotel soon.	
3168994	50012753	We had a family room on the first floor which was large and spacious.		80013364	Best regards, Anne Anne O'Leary Operations Manager	
3168994	50012754	The only downside was when you flushed the toilet there would be an uneartly whine until the water filled in.				
3168994	50012755	The beds are very comfortable and the staff are very friendly as one would expect.				
3168994	50012756	It is rather old fashioned				
3168994	50012757	but I like the character of the place.				
3168994	50012758	The breakfast is delicious and you have a choice of fried or poached eggs made for you.				
3168994	50012759	It is in an ideal location in the centre of town.				
3168994	50012760	We shopped around and got the bed and breakfast cheaper on a 3rd party website which unfortunately the hotel couldn't match.				
3168994	50012761	Next we go to Cork we will definitely be staying at the Imperial.				

3189350	50012770	Spacious and modern apartment - park view with norfolk pine trees ---SEP---		80013375	Many thanks for taking the time to comment on your recent stay at Oaks Plaza Pier.	
3189350	50012771	This apartment seems larger than usual as you can close off the bedroom with sliding doors and watch TV in there.		80013376	We are pleased to hear that you found your apartment to be large with a good size balcony to take in the beautiful views.	
3189350	50012772	There is also a good sized balcony which catches the morning sun.		80013377	We hope to welcome you back again soon next time you are visiting Glenelg.	
3189350	50012773	The kitchen is well-equipped with a dishwasher, microwave and oven and there is also a washer/dryer.				
3189350	50012774	There are three restaurants downstairs (owned separately from the apartments so there is no room service).				
3189350	50012775	The pool is good, also, but quite cold.				
3189350	50012776	As mentioned by other reviewers the staff are not friendly.				
3189350	50012777	The apartments are built on the beach, close to the Beachouse (full of fun for kids) and Jetty Road, the main shopping drag.				
3189350	50012778	It's lovely to walk along the beachfront and if you are a history buff take a look at the Bay Discovery Centre in Molsley Square (Glenelg Town Hall - no entry fee).				
3189350	50012779	The tram runs from Molsey Square straight into the city regularly.				

3174996	50012780	Great skyline view, comfortable beds ---SEP---		80013388	Dear Fearless30792709540, Thank you for your review and for choosing One King West.	
3174996	50012781	This was possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on.		80013389	I am glad to hear that overall your experience was an enjoyable one and that our modern comfortable suites were instrumental in making your stay an enjoyable one.	
3174996	50012782	Beware staying in a room on upper levels, while the view is beautiful, the elevators may mean you're waiting for quite a while, but just adjust your schedule on busy mornings and enjoy the view		80013390	We strive to be the hotel our guests call home and it is always rewarding to hear that our efforts have been recognized and appreciated.	
3174996				80013391	Thank you for letting us know about your experience with the elevators during your stay.	
3174996				80013392	We are aware of this issue and are looking for ways to resolve it.	
3174996				80013393	Again, thank you for your review and I look forward to welcoming you back in the future.	
3174996				80013394	Regards, Steve O'Brien General Manager	

3164910	50012790	Best place on the east coast!		80013405	HAHA, thanks nickw658, Sorry about testing your primate abilities, we're just launching the new lock system, and there's obviously been a few hiccups.	
3164910	50012791	---SEP---		80013406	Hopefully it didn't ruin your stay, I'll make sure Jolanta gets some love for making sure your stay was great.	
3164910	50012792	I checked into Base twice when I was Airlie Beach and greeted by the amazing Jolanta on both occasions who was a super helpful receptionist who went well out her way and beyond duties to help me on many occasions and make my stay comfortable.		80013407	Hope the rest of your travels are amazing Cheers, Tom	
3164910	50012793	Shed bar is an awesome atmosphere, the pool is lush, the rooms are the perfect temperature and the beds comfortable.				
3164910	50012794	My only criticism is the locks.				
3164910	50012795	Getting in is like trying to defuse a bomb.				
3164910	50012796	I felt like an Orangutan trying to finger paint... ask for a key card ;)				

3276077	50012800	Convienient ---SEP---		80013418	Dear hoperp, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel following your recent stay with us.	
3276077	50012801	A modern easily accessable hotel adjacent to Heathrow T5.		80013419	I am thrilled to know that you enjoyed the convenience of our location, also you were impressed with our soundproofing despite the fact that we are connected to terminal 5 via a covered walkway.	
3276077	50012802	No need to step outside, direct access by lift and dedicated walkway.		80013420	Thank you again for choosing the Sofitel London Heathrow, we look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.	
3276077	50012803	Rooms were quite spacious, clean and very quiet no aircraft noises		80013421	Yours Sincerely, James Berry ‚Äì General Manager Sofitel London Heathrow	
3276077	50012804	despite the fact it is so close to the airport and T5.				

3307946	50012810	Awful Experience with Front Desk Staff ---SEP---		80013432	We apologize for the experience and the matter is being looked into and the staff will be corrected.	
3307946	50012811	I stayed here on business 6/24-6/25/2019.		80013433	We do appreciate the feedback.	
3307946	50012812	It's budget hotel and my expectations weren't especially high				
3307946	50012813	so I didn't take issue with the super low-flow shower pressure, loud A/C or lukewarm breakfast buffet and coffee.				
3307946	50012814	What drove me to write this review was the absolutely awful customer service I received from the front desk manager on the night of 6/24.				
3307946	50012815	I dropped off laundry monday am and was told it would be back in my room 6-7pm.				
3307946	50012816	When I returned at 7:30 it wasn't there				
3307946	50012817	so I called down to the front desk and was told that they didn't have my clothes and I should call the dry cleaner.				
3307946	50012818	When I explained that she's the one who should call the dry cleaner, she hung up on me.				
3307946	50012819	After 3 unanswered calls to the front desk, she finally answered to tell me my clothes never went to the dry cleaner and they were at the front desk.				
3307946	50012820	When I was asked for an explanation as to why this happened, she told me that she would have to get back to me and hung up.				
3307946	50012821	She never called me back and 5 calls to the front desk went unanswered before I had to go down to the front desk myself.				
3307946	50012822	At the front desk i was handed my clothes and offered no apology or explanation, in fact the front desk manager said absolutely nothing.				
3307946	50012823	How do people like this get jobs in the hospitality business and how does Holiday Inn/IHG let them slip through the cracks?				

3190697	50012830	Location is horrible ---SEP---		80013444	Thank you for taking the time to give us some feedback regarding your stay.	
3190697	50012831	We're here in Denver to attend a conference.		80013445	I am sorry you were disappointed with our location.	
3190697	50012832	Downtown Denver is pricey so we stayed here for a more reasonable price.		80013446	We are located in an industrial area right off the highway.	
3190697	50012833	Long story short, pay the extra to stay elsewhere.		80013447	While it is not convenient for walking we are just 10-15 minutes from so many great places in Denver including Coors Field, Pepsi Center, Elitch Gardens, National Western Complex, Union Station and many more.	
3190697	50012834	This hotel is near NOTHING.		80013448	Compared to Downtown Denver's high hotel and parking prices, we are a great value.	
3190697	50012835	U can't walk to anything.		80013449	We do offer our shuttle for guests that do not have a car.	
3190697	50012836	Half of our room plugs don't work, lamp doesn't work, tap in kitchenette also doesn't work.				
3190697	50012837	Internet is painfully slow, like dial up kind of bad.				
3190697	50012838	There are a couple positives - they offer shuttle service to quite a few locations, including several places downtown and the airport.				
3190697	50012839	They also have a pool here.				
3190697	50012840	Aaaand, that's about it.				
3190697	50012841	If you're looking to find a reasonably priced hotel, search for hotels about 20 mins outside of the city but located in populated areas so that you have somewhere to eat or possibly shop.				
3190697	50012842	Closest place to buy beer is a 20 min walk away.				
3190697	50012843	Having said all this, if you're driving here, these may not be as much of an issue, but for anyone flying here without a vehicle, definitely choose a different location.				

3299731	50012850	Staying at this hotel feels like staying with family!		80013450	DSav, You said you can't say enough positives about it - I'll give that two thumbs up!	
3299731	50012851	---SEP---		80013451	A great review to read and it sounds like our staff went way above and beyond your expectations for your stay.	
3299731	50012852	My sisters and cousins held a reunion in Denver and stayed at this hotel.		80013452	I'm very happy that you all had such a great time.	
3299731	50012853	We can't say enough positives about it!		80013453	When it's your turn to plan the next reunion, I hope you'll pick us again!	
3299731	50012854	The hotel shuttle from the airport was convenient, friendly, and on time.				
3299731	50012855	The rooms were clean and well-maintained.				
3299731	50012856	The breakfast buffet had better-than-average selections and a friendly staff that tried hard to please.				
3299731	50012857	Each day the management provided a reception from 5-7 with free beer, wine, soda, crackers, cheese, nibbles, and, one afternoon, hot hors doerves.				
3299731	50012858	The pleasant breakfast room always had fresh coffee, teas, and fruit, so when we weren't out on the town, our group enjoyed using it for cards and conversation.				
3299731	50012859	During our stay our rental car malfunctioned, and the staff pitched in with tools to try to fix the problem; when that didn't work, the staff pulled strings to expedite a replacement vehicle nearby.				
3299731	50012860	Overall, we felt like like we were staying with family!				

3324675	50012870	nice place to stay ---SEP---		80013464	Dear Phil T Thank you for taking the time to share your comments on Tripadvisor following your recent stay with us at the Sligo City Hotel.	
3324675	50012871	We stayed here by chance.		80013465	We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us here and also that we were recommended to you.	
3324675	50012872	We weren't planning on staying in Sligo, but the city's charm held us.		80013466	We look forward to seeing you back with us very soon Trevor Canning General Manager	
3324675	50012873	We asked where to find a clean, convenient, reasonably priced room and several people recommended this hotel.				
3324675	50012874	We were very pleased, and would stay here again.				

3193557	50012880	Bussiness ---SEP---		80013477	Thank you Shebusybee for your review, our apologies for the delayed response as we have been on a short break.	
3193557	50012881	The service here is always amazing.		80013478	It has been our pleasure to welcome you and all of your staff to the Altitude for the past 4 years.	
3193557	50012882	We have stayed here four years running.		80013479	We look forward to welcoming you all back again next year.	
3193557	50012883	Consistent is the word for this Motel.		80013480	Take Care and thank you again.	
3193557	50012884	Always and still greeted with a smile, rooms utensil etc always clean.		80013481	Kind Regards, Bruce and mary	
3193557	50012885	You will not find fault here!				
3193557	50012886	Even the sharp knives are sharp....you can slice your tomatoes no worries.				
3193557	50012887	We stay in plenty of places and the knives are always blunt.				

3260662	50012890	Spa weekend ---SEP---		80013492	Dear Nead22, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel and for your kind words with regards the hotel and d√©cor.	
3260662	50012891	Fab hotel and fab decor.		80013493	I am delighted that you enjoyed your breakfast and dinner experience.	
3260662	50012892	We had lovley room with a nice view.		80013494	I was disappointed to hear that you found that the 'make-up wasn't anything special' and that you found that your spa treatments were missing something.	
3260662	50012893	The breakfast and dinner was enjoyable.		80013495	I will make sure your feedback is passed onto the spa team .	
3260662	50012894	We booked in for hair,make-up and spa treatments.		80013496	I do hope to welcome you back to the hotel , it has been completely refurbished since your last visit.	
3260662	50012895	The hair was lovley.		80013497	Kind Regards John O'Malley	
3260662	50012896	The make-up wasn't anything special.				
3260662	50012897	The spa treatments were nice but out of 7 girls we all agreed it was missing something.				
3260662	50012898	We couldn't relax fully for some reason!				
3260662	50012899	Would still stay here again but wouldn't use the spa facilities again				

3262772	50012900	Cold ---SEP---		80013508	Hello Ian, Thank you for visiting Mantra Lorne.	
3262772	50012901	Room was cold and heater didnt work very well and was noisy all night, room was dirty and they couldnt tell us if we could park our car close to our room as there is limited parking around the rooms.		80013509	Your feedback has been shared with the team and will assist us in targeting areas for improvement, so thank you for sharing your experience.	
3262772	50012902	Was not very impressed		80013510	Cheers Abraham	

3263247	50012910	Facility was great.....food not so much ---SEP---		80013521	Hi Fred, Thank you, you contacted me directly and I have responded to you, again I am sorry that you were so disappointed.	
3263247	50012911	We are annual visitors to LBLR, one of our favourite mini holiday destinations every year.		80013522	We will be pleased to welcome you back, on your next visit.	
3263247	50012912	The usual creature comforts were at their usual high standard but, this trip, the food disappointed.		80013523	Best wishes, Tim Hackett	
3263247	50012913	On Friday, 15FEB2019, dinner was inedible.				
3263247	50012914	Didn't have the heart to bother the server, a delightful young man from Oakville, who was a pleasure to deal with.				
3263247	50012915	Not sure who was chef that night, but my ling cod and shrimp were so oversalted that 3 bites was all I could manage.				
3263247	50012916	These seafood choices are subtly flavoured, requiring a deft touch with seasonings.				
3263247	50012917	Dinner was a bust as a result.				
3263247	50012918	My wife was less than enamoured with her food as well.				
3263247	50012919	We'll be back, but the great room may be for morning coffee and a newspaper.... dinner not so much.				
3263247	50012920	Fred Pinnock, North Vancouver				

3275265	50012930	gorgeous dog-friendly boutique hotel, just remember your earplugs!!!		80013534	Dear TheFoodie8, Many thanks for taking the time to leave your review; all of your comments have been taken on board.	
3275265	50012931	---SEP---		80013535	I'm very glad we were able to accommodate your dog on your family trip and I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the location and decor of the hotel and the breakfast on offer.	
3275265	50012932	I really recommend it as a hotel that allows dog, that was our priority, to find a nice mid-high range hotel that would allow dogs, and for that reason it fitted the bill.		80013536	I'm very saddened to hear that you did not receive the high level of service from some of our staff that we usually pride ourselves on.	
3275265	50012933	Our priority for this family trip was to bring our dog so we searched high and low for a hotel that allowed dogs, most of them were fully booked but luckily Abbey Hotel still had 2 rooms available.		80013537	I can only apologise; your issues have been raised and we will look to ensure that incidents like these do not happen again.	
3275265	50012934	The dogs are not allowed to stay on the top floor so if you bring a dog you will be given either a basement room or on 2nd and 3rd floor.		80013538	I'm also sorry to hear that you lost sleep due to noise during your visit.	
3275265	50012935	UNFRIENDLY FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF So apart from a staff member called Luke who assisted us with dog-friendly recommendations, most of the staff were pretty unfriendly.		80013539	We hope that you will come back and visit us again in the future and we hope to provide you with our usual better level of service next time.	
3275265	50012936	As you walked passed the reception they would be occupied amongst themselves and not really acknowledge you.		80013540	Kind regards, Andrew Foulkes, General Manager	
3275265	50012937	When you did go up to ask a question they were quite blase about answering.				
3275265	50012938	They were generally fine but just don't expect 4-5* service from them.				
3275265	50012939	The least friendly and most abrasive was probably the female restaurant manager.				
3275265	50012940	It wasn't quite the tone or attitude I would expect of someone manager a hotel restaurant, especially one that is popular like this one.				
3275265	50012941	DON'T FORGET EARPLUGS				
3275265	50012942	This is a hard one, it's just unfortunate that the building is very old (although nicely renovated and decorated), so you hear EVERY SINGLE footstep.				
3275265	50012943	Now we took 2 rooms, one on the top floor and one in the basement, and we all lost sleep due to the noises of people running up and down the stairs, walking through the hotel and through the lobby...				
3275265	50012944	This was quite a let down for us because apart from that the hotel is very well decorated.				
3275265	50012945	Just be prepared with your earplugs I'd say.				
3275265	50012946	The breakfast is quite worth getting it's ¬£15 for a hot breakfast (I took the delicious full English breakfast)				
3275265	50012947	and then there is the buffet with the usual suspects (croissants, fruit juice, fruit, yoghurt, ham, cheese).				
3275265	50012948	GREAT LOCATION				
3275265	50012949	If you don't drive or prefer not to take the car, this is the perfect hotel as far as location is concerned.				
3275265	50012950	It's walking distance from the Roman Baths, all the shops and pubs too.

3261537	50013060	Not impressed!!		80013691	Dear Guest, We're sorry to hear you were not satisfied during your stay with us.	
3261537	50013061	---SEP---		80013692	It was myself who came and checked the room after you advised there was a smoke smell, and I could smell it very faintly.	
3261537	50013062	We reserved a room with a crib as we had a baby with us.		80013693	Most likely it had come in through the open window from someone smoking in the car parking area.	
3261537	50013063	First room we checked into smelled horribly of smoke.		80013694	The new room we gave you was just down the hall from the original, backing onto the car parking area once more (not an alley).	
3261537	50013064	We were then given a room at the back alley.		80013695	In regards to the ramp, these are in place so that the housekeepers can navigate their supplies sufficiently through the hotel.	
3261537	50013065	We tried a third roomon the second floor.		80013696	These are easily pulled up and fastened against the wall, so that guests can safely proceed up and down the small flights of stairs.	
3261537	50013066	Unlike other places we have stayed, the crib was not set up for us.		80013697	The ramps should always be in the upright position once housekeeping has finished for the day, so our sincere apologies for the issue you experienced with this.	
3261537	50013067	We had to go up a VERY steep makeshift platform to get to our room.		80013698	We are now looking at taking these out and changing our procedures for the housekeepers.	
3261537	50013068	With a stroller,it was very dangerous because it was so steep.		80013699	Once again, we're very sorry for the issues you experienced, and hope you may give us another chance if you're ever visiting Banff in the future.	
3261537	50013069	NOT safe at all & should not be allowed.		80013700	Warm Regards, Laura Preston Front Office Manager	
3261537	50013070	We lost control of the stroller on the way down!				
3261537	50013071	Its a good thing the baby was not in it!!!We were very disappointed and wanted to get out to enjoy Banff so did not complain but certainly will not be going back.				
3261537	50013072	Safety is worth the extra to stay elsewhere and I cannot understand how this passes code for a hotel!				

3172530	50013080	Lovely clean place ---SEP---		80013711	Thank you for the great review!	
3172530	50013081	This is my second time staying here.		80013712	We have recently put brand new beds in each of our rooms so we love hearing positive feedback about them.	
3172530	50013082	The rooms are so clean and the bed is so comfortable.		80013713	We hope to see you back for another visit.	
3172530	50013083	Highly recommend.				
3172530	50013084	Staff are always polite and friendly.				
3172530	50013085	Room was quiet.				
3172530	50013086	There is a supermarket across the road.				

3207998	50013090	right next to the airport, friendly staff ---SEP--- Check in was smooth.		80013724	I am pleased that you were satisfied with the service and accommodations here.	
3207998	50013091	The front desk was very friendly.		80013725	The team and I look forward to again hosting your stay during your visit in the Charlotte area.	
3207998	50013092	The room was clean.				
3207998	50013093	The breakfast was standard Hampton Inn.				
3207998	50013094	The breakfast area was busy, but things filled up quickly.				
3207998	50013095	There were three hot items (eggs, sausage, bacon or home fries).				
3207998	50013096	The hotel was really close to the airport, so you can definitely hear the airplanes flying over.				
3207998	50013097	It was a little noisy for me.				
3207998	50013098	And there were no restaurants in walking distance.				
3207998	50013099	There is a gas station and 7-11 right next door.				

3165203	50013100	Best Rehoboth wedding retreat.		80013736	Thank you for the response!	
3165203	50013101	---SEP---		80013737	We encourage you to come back for a return visit so you can enjoy all those things you missed out on this time.	
3165203	50013102	We so enjoyed our stay at the Bell for.		80013738	The Bellmoor is not the same without enjoying our spa or pools.	
3165203	50013103	We did not have time to take advantage of the spa or pools but definitely, enjoyed the breakfast, shady outdoor areas, and convenience to the beach.		80013739	We hope to see you soon.	
3165203	50013104	We look forward to returning.
