I can't say enough about our stay at the Evelyn over Thanksgiving. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel welcome. I loved the Art Deco decor in the lobby, as well as the new bakery and restaurant. We stayed for two nights with our young daughters in a room with a king size bed and sofa bed (in a separate room). This type of set up is usually very hard to find in NYC, unless you go to a chain hotel or want to pay thousands for a suite. It was very well thought out and perfect for our family. We arrived late and someone from housekeeping came right away when we called to set up the sofa bed. The staff was so nice and beautifully made up the sofa bed for our girls, and brought us extra towels. The king size bed was super comfortable and the blackout blinds helped everyone sleep. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to tons of restaurants and stores, as well as museums and a show in midtown. I would definitely stay here again. I stayed here once solo before the completed renovations.

729526,Hotel,5,ceedee3,TrumpHotel,"Fantastic stay! ---SEP--- We chose Chicago and the Trump International Hotel for 3 nights late Sept to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and we were very happy we did! The service was top notch and everyone was very friendly. Before we arrived, I had emailed the hotel with a question and received an answer within the hour! The location is perfect – right downtown, very central and right on the banks of the Chicago River, next to the Wrigley building. The regular hotel rooms are on floors 18-27, so the views from any rooms are great ones. We looked out over the river and could see out to Lake Michigan. We took the train in from O’Hare and it was a quick 7 min walk from the station at Clark and Lake to the hotel. Check in was easy, the gal serving us was friendly - we had been upgraded to a spa room on the 14th floor then we were pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries waiting for us in our room with a note from the Vice-President congratulating us on our anniversary. The room was spacious, the bathroom beautiful (very deep tub, TV in the mirror), and all the amenities hit the right note – from the wonderful pillow menu to the thick comfy robes, the UV towel warmer in the closet, The nightly turn down service was a treat – they brought bottled water, turned the music on, dimmed the lights and left the TV on a soothing aquarium screen – very soothing and relaxing. They paid attention to the small details - I liked that the bottled water and glass were left on a tray with paper so there was no noisy clink when I set the glass down after having a drink in the middle of the night and the card with the weather forecast reminded us what to expect the following morning. Each evening they filled the ice bucket with fresh ice, just in case you needed it. The Nespresso coffee system was great (6 discs total with the fixings) and we enjoyed having a couple coffees in our room every morning. The mini bar had lots of options and the imported bottled beer was reasonable ($7) given the class of hotel. When we came back to the hotel around 5 pm on our third night, the room hadn’t been made up yet, so we called the front desk. They asked when it would be convenient for us for them to correct this - we said 6:30 as we were going to be leaving then for dinner. Less than 5 mins after making the call, the maid knocked on our door and also asked when it would be convenient for her to make up the room – and we gave her the same information. That night when we returned, we were treated to 8 beautiful handmade chocolates. The only thing I would change/improve would be to add a makeup mirror in the bathroom. They had a lighted one out on the desk and I usually used it, with natural light from the windows for make up in the am. A make up mirror wall mounted in the bathroom on the wall would have been easier for those of us who are very near sighted (me -without my glasses on) and wouldn’t use up counter space. The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff friendly and our room was so quiet we felt like we were staying in an apartment, rather than a hotel. The location was perfect – it was a 5 minute walk to the boat tours, a 15 min walk to Millennium Park, and 20 minutes to Navy Pier. We would recommend this hotel very highly!","Dear Guest, I am happy to extend my congratulations on your recent 20th wedding anniversary.

This hotel feels very modern and clean and is in a nice location. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The room was big and comfortable. But a few niggles let the hotel down. Firstly I didnt have a remote control for the TV. I called down for it but they didnt bring one up. I used the gym a couple of times. It is very small (and a little smelly) for a hotel of this size. It seemed thrown in the basement as an afterthought. Also, the gym has sensor driven lights which arent triggered when you are on a running machine. I spent an hour running, 45 minutes of which was in the pitch dark. They provide towels in the Gym, but nowhere to put dirty towels. And a very minor gripe - I have a personal dislike of baths where you cant turn the water off with your foot. With this one you had to keep getting out of the bath to top up the bath with water.","Thank you for taking the time to post a review following your recent stay at Hilton Belfast. I am pleased you had a great stay with us and appreciate your constructive feedback regarding the bath and Livingwell Express Gym, and I shall certainly share your comments with the relevant Managers.

However, after using this hotel for nearly ten years I have now decided not to stay there again. Just about nothing is right with it. The car park is sometimes so full of cars that you cannot find a space to park (usually from non-guests such as freemasons attending events there); the rooms are stifling hot and cannot be cooled down by opening the windows; there were the previous guests' pubic hairs around the lavatory in my room and a very long black hair in my ""clean"" bath towel; the ""hot food"" served at breakfast time always seems to be cold; a heavy lorry was unloaded outside my ""seaview"" room at 3am in the morning (and through the same doors that guests use); the lift takes ages to go between floors and only holds four people; and worse than any of that, the once friendly atmosphere seems to have gone. All the staff in the dining room come from Eastern Europe and I don't recall one of them smiling or saying ""hello"". (They all looked as hard as nails too). I was even amazed to see a portrait of Britain's arch-enemy, Napoleon Bonaparte, hanging in reception! The next time I will be staying in the Royal Bath Hotel across the road.","Disillusioned to read this post and concerned that we cannot identify the guest to confirm such a negative review.

2709632,Hotel,4,Bbbelz,Tim_MoloneyQSDB,"Modern, Well Kept, Friendly Staff. ---SEP--- We recently stayed here on a weekend trip to Warrnambool. Overall, the hotel is very modern and well maintained, clean and fresh. The rooms are nice, general size of a hotel room, with a king size bed, not sure if this is the norm thou. There is a small balcony too, we didn't have ocean views but didn't pay for them so we weren't expecting them. The TV is large and the bathroom does have a sliding door/mirror which unfortunatley can be a bit annoying having to close it every time you need to use the toilet but I get that they have gone for a modern design. The only problem with the bathroom is the shower... be careful you don't slip on any water! The shower door isn't big enough and water tends to leak out onto the floor! Our accomodation also included continental breakfast, which was also very good, the usual cereals, fruits, toasts and pastries. We also decided to make use of the spa and used the private geo mineral baths. It's $25 per person for private and $15 for public. Pay the extra and get the private! All in all, the staff were very friendly and helpful. My only concerns are the later check in of 2pm, the water coming out of the shower and the price comparrison to other resorts in the area. However, it can be overlooked and certainly didn't ruin my experience! I would highly recommend the Quality Deep Blue if you are going to be spending most of your time out and about discovering Warrnambool's tourist attractions and eating out as it is purely just a nice hotel room, there are no cooking facilities or a separate dining area. This is a classy, well kept place to stay as a weekend escape for a couple who want to relax and if so, do make use of the spa! It really isn't the place for families with young kids, big groups of people or couples wanting to spend long periods of time in their room.","Dear Bbbelz, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us. I am delighted you enjoyed your time here. In particular, I am pleased you enjoyed our Private 40 degree Mineral Pools.

We were allocated a pleasant room but could hear a constant droning noise. Opened curtain to unveil the hotel's air conditioning plant. As a light sleeper, I asked to move as it would keep me awake. We were shown another room which was marginally larger than a cupboard and still overlooking the air con plant. We were then shown a room on the opposite side of the hotel, which we accepted. We assumed it would have air con as the other two did. I asked one of the receptionists if we could move as the room was uncomfortably hot. He said only premium sea-facing rooms had air con. I reminded him that the two rooms they had offered both had air con. His solution was an electric fan. We are regular visitors to Brighton, but would recommend staying here.","Dear walesjos Thank you for taking the time to add your review to Trip-advisor. I would like to express and offer my sincerest apologies for the shortfall in the standards and the experience you had while staying with us. Unfortunately not all of our bedrooms have air conditioning, and the exceptionally hot weather meant some of our rooms did become very hot. Please accept my unreserved apologies that my team did not demonstrate the service levels which we are normally so proud of, when requesting a room move.

From the moment we entered we were approached with a smart comment because 3 of us had the same colour coats.....then we got the wrong steaks and when we questioned them we were laughed at-literally, and they were swapped around the table-even tho one was covered in salt. We had to ask for our bottle of wine both times we needed a refill, which i have never had to do in any restaurant. I think if they hadnt 4 or five different people serving the one table, it would have been much more personal and maybe we wouldnt have been forgotten about! They did however give us the second bottle of wine free, even though they were discussing it on front of us-very unprofessionally.

I was then downgraded to a smaller room due to availability and after asking to be moved. In room 414 and from late Friday night until I check out at 0245am on the Saturday morning I have not been able to get sleep due to the deep base coming out of the nearby club. The windows are not double glazed as you can easily hear the street level noise (people, shouting, cars driving past) and the club. Pic attached. I would not recommend this hotel for those that are light sleepers or needing to get a good rest on a business trip. The gym is very small with some cardio equipment and a bench with dumbbells with a max weight of 10kg. The rooms are refurbished though very small for the cost. Pics on this review are of room 414. The staff at this hotel are nice and pleasant and addressed my queries and concerns as necessary. A few things I have not highlighted to staff which I hope they pick up on through this review: The toilet seat in 414 is missing a bolt on one side so is loose. One of the down buttons at the lift lobby on level 4 is not operational. The elliptical rower in the gym needs servicing due to excessive noise coming from the foot platforms.","Dear Pilot84, Thank you very much for your feedback.I am terribly sorry to read about the issues you had in both rooms.Please allow me to express my sincerest apologies.

1881835,Hotel,2,Sabrina P,Waymarker,"Not worth the price ---SEP--- We often stay in condo hotels in Canmore and since our usual one was booked, we decided to give Mystic Springs a try. We were very disappointed. We stayed in a two-storey two-bedroom unit as a family. The decor was tired, the bedsheets had holes in them (but were clean) and the beds were not very comfortable. The mattresses are wornout and need to be replaced. The walls need a repaint - they had chips and nicks all over. We were missing pillows, but they were brought over quickly. Everything was still ok until we went to the kitchen to make dinner and that was the worst. All of the dishes and pots were dirty - it took us almost an hour to rewash everything. And I don't mean slightly dirty - I mean caked on food on all of the plates. They looked like they were placed back into the cabinets dirty. The counters and tables were greasy. I cleaned the sink. The coffeepot was unusable because it had a crack in the bottom. The top of the toaster was gross and I had to clean that too. The kitchen table was also SO wobbly that nobody could even touch it or it would start shaking. This was a VERY disappointing experience. I don't come on vacation to clean someone else's vacation condo. We will never come back here again. It was a waste of money. The best thing about it was the manager on duty - Nicole - who was very helpful, very responsive, very nice, and even offered us a discount on a nightly rate. She was really awesome.

After coming across the Settlers Motel we went in for a look and were greeted with nothing less than exceptional service. Alan and Sally made us feel welcome and even provided us with toothbrushes and toothpaste since we had only our day bags with us. All services are included in the price such as WiFi, laundry, DVD's and the morning paper, a nice touch. We stayed in a ground floor studio with a king bed, kitchenette and bathroom. Everything was spotless, comfortable and well appointed. We felt very comfortable and while our stay was not planned it was by far the best room we have had while touring the south island.

2300053,Hotel,4,dazjob,Brett_Sweetman,"Good if you are posh ---SEP--- The Hotel Building and surrounding area are at the most beautiful and its location cannot be faulted. It was within easy reach of the Tram service and within walking distance of most areas of Melbourne. A nice and quiet area a very busy City. We were staying for a total of 14 nights and this was fully paid for before we arrived as my good lady had won a comp to go to Melbourne and stay at this hotel amongst other things. Anyone can see that the building and interior is at the highest of standard and would rival any 5 star hotel, As soon as we got to our Club Deluxe King room we were blown away as again the interior of the bedroom and bathroom were of the highest of standard and set with the view of the church it made for a great stay. My wife and I will never stop raving about the bed and those pillow – we have never wanted to stay in bed all day before but if we had the choice we probably would have as this was the best bed and sleep we have ever had, I would love to know the supplier of the pillows as I would buy them. The Bathroom was set out wonderfully and the daily refreshment of bathroom goodies shampoos etc were again high quality, the housekeeping team did a brilliant job each and every day. I would not stop raving about the Physical hotel and location enough. But would I come back to this Hotel again the answer would be a resounding NO, I have never in my life felt so uncomfortable in my life staying at any hotel due to my status I am not a rich man, I don’t have lots of money that I can throw about lavishly I would put myself middle class at best – The snobbish/belittling attitude that was first presented by the reception team and throughout our stay I would never want to feel again, We arrived after a long long flight and arrived early at the hotel hoping that there would be a possibility of checking in early and dumping our bags etc, We were dressed in jeans and t-shirt nowt smart and we arrived at the desk, The lady looked up from the impressive reception area and we introduced ourselves and asked the question all we got was NO so we asked if we could leave our bags and car etc early and again the response was a point across to the area the valet/porters were positioned and told take your stuff and they will look after it. The porters and Car valet guy were friendly and helpful throughout or stay. We returned back to the hotel some 5/6 hrs later and on speaking with the porters they told us they would arrange for our bags to be taken up to our room once we had checked in etc. so again we went to the desk and went to check in, There was complications on our booking as the pre-paid room was not on the system Luckily we had the paperwork to show this as reception were not aware of this as it was incorrectly imputed into the system, After sorting this out it came to paying the pre-auth ($100 dollars a day if pre-paid room or $100 on top of whatever your room rate was) This was settled and again the attitude and courtesy of the reception staff was extremely poor. I could see the attitude was lifted to a higher standard once a gentleman with a good suit or a lady who was dressed in a certain way came to the desk was treated with greater respect and courtesy which I feel is a totally incorrect to behave. We felt undressed and out of place and the lack of acknowledgement from the numerous staff that were at the desk was resounding. As days passed We found ourselves walking in the back way so we didn’t have to pass through reception at all. We thankfully chose to leave the hotel on a couple of nights and we stayed elsewhere where we returned to the relaxed holiday we wished for. I have never before paid to stay at different hotel during a hotel stay that was already paid for before but I am so glad we did. Our dealings with the Front of house team spoiled the hotel stay and for that reason alone I would not choose to stay here again which is such a shame as the Porters/Housekeeping team were fantastic and the hotel and surrounding area perfect for all our needs and the bed and pillows again just the best ever.","Dear dazjob, Thank you for your review following your stay at Park Hyatt Melbourne last month, I was pleased to hear you enjoyed the property and found the bed and pillows very comfortable.

It's outside of town, and not within walking distance. Breakfast is not included, but there's a Denny's restaurant on site. The room itself is old-fashioned, yet updated. The counter in the bathroom is very low - as is the water pressure! Soft towels and nice bath products. Bed was comfortable. We used our white noise app and slept well. The flatscreen TV only had analog programming....c'mon! Overall, not a bad place, good and clean, but I'd probably stay downtown next time.",Thanks for your feedback. That is true we are not right in town which is an advantage for some and not for others. Revelstoke does have a really nice downtown area which is only 10 minutes walk away or a very short drive. Next time you are going through take the time to discover it. Breakfast is a marketing strategy. Some hotels choose to do it and others don't. With a full service 24 hour Denny's on site we think this is a great feature. When we look at pricing against our competitors we always take the breakfast into consideration and price accordingly. We haven't finished updating all of our rooms. You mentioned counters and those will all be marble and there is new cabinets in the bathroom and for the fridge. They look great. They are coming soon. One of the downsides of being in a smaller community is technology. We really don't have all digital cable in town yet so no one has it here. Sorry we keep asking. The other thing is internet. There is limited bandwith available so it really won't seem like high speed to those coming from major communities. Believe me if it was available we would have it.

I have never been treated with such care and concern. I got to Phoenix earlier than the regular check in time but Julie at the front desk did not seem concerned or put out by that. She flagged housekeeping to clean my room as soon as possible and promised to call me when my room was ready. I found this incredibly kind because I've had other hotels be somewhat rude about this. On Thursday morning, I took a shower and experienced EXTREME shower pressure. It was so high that it actually flooded the bathroom. (Sorry about that, by the way.) I called the front desk and they were so nice about it. I apologized profusely but the person who answered told me she should be apologizing. She promised to have the room cleaned up and the shower pressure adjusted. Even the waiter at Networks was vastly accommodating. I've never received such good service and want you to know how much I appreciate it. Thank you!",We are happy to hear we blew you away with our exceptional service!

The hotel is nicely placed just a short walk into Newquay itself. The room we had was fine containing everything you need, and cleaned every day, no complaints. The entertainment each evening was very good, enjoyed the quizzes and performers, no complaints. The pool was lovely, but the jacuzzi wasn't working for the whole of our stay, disappointing. The staff are lovely, couldn't fault them. The food was fine for me but my husband is a vegetarian and there was little or no choice other than fish which becomes very repetitive over five days, no vegetarian options for breakfast, in this day and age perhaps some vegetarian sausages could be offered at little expense. The warmth of the food was a little hit and miss, sometimes red hot and sometimes cold. The car parking was horrendous, first come first served I understand that but when asking the receptionist when we arrived were told we could park in the pay and display car park next door at a cost of £15 per day, not happy and then overheard the same receptionist tell the gentleman behind me that there was a residential street just down the road that you could park in for free, not happy with that, we did find the street and parked there for our stay, but what did I do to that receptionist to be treated like that! We would stay here again, enjoyed it,",Thank you for your kind review of the Barrowfield Hotel.

1694310,Hotel,4,Echica1,Gillian E,"Great for a holiday. Not ideal for work trip. ---SEP--- I was here for a work trip. The room was inexpensive ($139) and great value. Very large, with a separate sleeping area, basic kitchenette, spacious living area and balcony and large bathroom with a spa. All very clean. There was no desk, and no power points within reach of the small, built in dining table so I had to work with my laptop balanced on the sofa. Not ideal. Also no in-room safe or minibar. Room service is via local restaurants, so if you want an alcoholic drink you need to order separately through the hotel, which has a minimum of 1 bottle of wine or 6 beers. Great if you're a group/couple on holiday but not catering at all to the solo traveller just after a glass of wine with dinner. Supermarket is just next door so I ended up self catering which was ok but wouldn't have worked if I had arrived late etc. The gym is ok for cardio; no free weights. Location is great, right on the esplanade and close to many shops and restaurants. In all, a great option for a relaxed holiday but not really well catered to a solo working trip.","Dear Echica1 Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent stay with us here at Mantra Mooloolaba Beach, we always appreciate receiving constructive comments which help us maintain and improve our standards, as well as meet and exceed guest’s expectations.

Myself & my 2 daughters have made a new tradition that over the Christmas holidays we now treat ourselves to the fantastic Afternoon tea at this Grand Hotel. It all started when we had my eldest daughters hen party here. Not your normal hen party but as my daughter was pregnant my younger daughter thought it would be something different & so she organised the whole thing. The customer service at the Chesterfield is exemplary they let us decorate the area we my daughters hen in & they just couldn't do enough for us. That hen afternoon tea had the theme of ""Willy Wonker Chocolate afternoon tea"" it was stunning. The different teas, sandwiches, cakes, pastries & traditional scones with jam & clotted cream were out of this world & just kept coming. As soon as the food started going down the waiting staff replaced whatever was missing. The staff are I think some of if not the best I have ever come across, since that event was so successful we have returned on another 2 occasions. Once as part of my Christmas present on New Years Eve 2016 & then again New Years Day 2018. Each time the service & food is stunning. But please don't take my word for it. Experience the experience for yourselves. You will not be disappointed.","Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to share this review your recent experience with us at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.
