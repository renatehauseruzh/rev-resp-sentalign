We stayed in a 2BR unit which had stunning views of the valley. It was quite spacious and comfortable. I will add that the d√©cor seemed a bit worn. We had a very pleasant check-in and were impressed by the woman at reception who was managing two surly guests with grace while we waited. The complaints we heard were ridiculous and she was so composed. She checked us in quickly and in a friendly manner. We enjoyed a the walking trail around the property and our teen girls liked the giant chess game on the lawn. We had dinner at Rae's, which was delicious and allowed for an incredible view as well.

3173251,Hotel,5,KatMcP,Rory M,"Very good hotel ---SEP--- Stayed here for work for one night. Staff were extremely friendly, greeting me as I got out of the lift (reception is on 1st floor) and asking lots of genuine questions about why I was there and how they could help. Room was possibly the cleanest I have ever stayed in, but didn't' appear to have a window until I found it hidden behind a wardrobe in the small alcove at the back right of the room. Even then it only overlooked a small light well about 12 foot wide but which was so tall I couldn't actually see sky/the weather at the top! Weirder still you look straight into other rooms which made me close the curtains to my room despite it only being mid afternoon, so there was essentially no window in the room. This is my only criticism, and a fairly minor one at that. Decor is quirky but functional and the free breakfast is plentiful and tasty. Location is excellent, just a few minutes from both main train stations and a few steps from the shopping and most main areas. I had a good nights sleep and really appreciated the USB socket next to the.bed for phone chargers!","Hello KatMcP Firstly, great to hear your room was super clean, ill let the housekeeping team and Klaudia know( they probably read this as they all do) Some of our rooms are a bit of a weird shape its true, this is due to the nature of the building and as such we have tried to make the most of natural light and the space itself. We are a square building so yes, some rooms look onto others, these internal rooms are the favourites of the ""in the know"" guests who like a deep sleep as they are silent. You can always draw the net curtain for privacy while still allowing for natural light. Sounds like everything else was peachy though. God times.

We had to request toast 3 times one morning and when it eventually came it was without butter! They appeared to not want to serve more than 1 glass of fruit juice per person either. On Saturday evening it was busy so we expected a wait but it was about an hour each between the starter, main and dessert and even then they forgot the extras we had ordered. Sunday night was much quieter but alas we still had the same problems. The food when it eventually came was very good. We ordered cocktails but they had run out of cocktail glasses in which to serve them in. Not quite the same having a cosmopolitan served in a brandy glass!

The hotel is very well positioned if you want to visit New York - near time square and all the metro, but not with the noise of the street.

To have this discount, I recommend you book directly on the web site of the hotel (not with agencies which do not give you the discount) Good restaurant in the hotel for breakfast.

3250583,Hotel,3,labella102,TwelveHotelGalway,"West restaurant fantastic, hotel tired and taken over by locals ---SEP--- My partner booked two nights for our anniversary and I was really looking forward to it having read all the reviews and looked at pics. We had a suite with a bar in it but it was structure only, had a microwave but no cutlery or plates and mini bar had no red or white wine, but for a ‚Ç¨5 euro service charge they brought some wine. On arrival there was a drill on one of the tables apparently someone was putting a hook on bathroom door. Went for a drink in the Pins Bar to get over our long trip and providing there is no one in the bar you can get table service. Thankfully and the one thing that saved our break was the West restaurant where the food is without reservation some of the best I have ever tasted, and the wine selection amazing, would go back for the food but would probably stay elsewhere it was ‚Ç¨199 per night that did include breakfast and our meal in The West (no wine). I had read that they had jazz in The Pins but sadly not anymore. On second day we went for a drive to explore had a lovely day but when we came back football was on and no seats in The Pins and no residents bar. I cannot honestly say it was a complete washout but it was also not what they bill it as on their site, so by all means go, worth it for food alone but don't bother with the overpriced suites, we spent no time in the extra space as there was nothing in it. I presume that the reason we had no bath in the room was because we had the bar not worth it.","Dear Labella1, Once again, thank you for your visit and thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience. I am delighted to see you had high expectations prior to your arrival due to the research you did on third party review sites such as Trip Advisor. The overwhelming comments on these sites by guests who have stayed at The Twelve are namely about::- 1) how wonderful the staff are, 2) how great their dining experiences were, 3) how wonderul the atmosphere is and 4) how true the Twelve's website is to actual reality. You can therefore understand my disappointment when we did not live up to your expectations on the latter two. The Twelve is very much unlike the vast majority of hotels and this is why it is so well liked. Our local bar atmosphere is an integral part of our successful formula and it is something we shout about proudly on our website. It is this beautiful buzz which helps make The Twelve what it is. Along with our staff and perfect location, the other wonderful elements are our devotion to great food and wine. I am delighted to see you had a terrific experience in West. We have been greatly honoured with numerous accolades for West's cuisine as well as our wine list which has won pretty much every wine award there is to win. We do feature free live entertainment every weekend. On Fridays, it is always Traditional Irish music sessions - really good sessions. Saturdays, however lend thmselves to more variety. Sometimes it is Jazz, other times it is Blues. We always try to mix it up and the reason for this is based upon feedback from our guests. Our Facebook page always has the most up to the minute infomation. There are two end suites in the hotel which were designed for guests who want walk in showers rather than a bath. When you book directly on The Twelve's official website, you are given the luxury of choice. Unfortunately, this is not possible on third party sites. Labella, I really wish you had given us the opportunity to make some sort of service recovery whilst you were staying with us. Our goal is to ensure every guest has a wonderful time at The Twelve.

A tired, dated room with a squeaky bed that was medium-comfortable. The walls were full of holes from old fittings, the furniture had seen better days and the bathroom was also in need of a refurbish. Stupid wee things - the toilet roll holder hung off the wall and it fell on the floor all the time. None of these things matter when you're asleep so a good night's sleep would have made me less critical. My room was at the back of the hotel and quiet on the first night (bank holiday). On the second n get there was someone in the room above me and next to me. You could hear every footstep and the floorboards sounded like they were ready to collapse. Every person going upstairs sounded like they were stomping in my room. Being near reception there were voices every time someone came in. The heating/cooling unit made a buzzing noise for a few seconds every ten mins waking up a light sleeper. The glass and bottle brought from the 'bar' (small fridge at reception) was not cleared out of my room after the first day. Staff were pleasant and I was asked on departure if they could do anything to help after I complained about noise. Short of new floorboards nothing could help after the event. Breakfast ok. Staff not identified with either uniforms or badges. Won't be back. From the reviews there are obviously some nice rooms - perhaps on top floor wth nobody above.

Negatives: - Room was not updated and felt like an old Holiday Inn. Looked nothing like website photos. - The wifi situation SUCKS. There is ""free"" temporary wifi in rooms but I couldn't get a signal. I tried to pay repeatedly for the actual wifi and was unable. A 5-star hotel must include superior wifi service in all rooms. - The coffee bar took three people and 15 minutes to make a latte and topped it with cocoa powder? - While my starter and the bread/butter at dinner were very good, the service was terrible (he'd disappear for ages) and the Salmon main was undercooked and bland. I don't even remember dessert. And expensive! - Room service pizza was a fluffy mess. - I felt, even at $175/night that I overpaid.","Dear PaulusHookJC, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Hilton Glasgow.

The business center is a joke, on three occasions I went down to print documents from my thumb drive to find the printer not working, copying on one occasion was also not possible due to the cartridge being empty. There wasn't so much as a stapler to be found (you might want to see what your competition doing in this area).

This is the lowest I found for this weekend in downtown Indy. The hotel is near the Residence Inn on the Canal. The staff is very professional and very helpful. My room had a few issues (toilet handle needed adjusting) which were promptly dealt with. Laundry room if you need to do laundry (for a dollar-with free detergent). Free internet in the business center. Skip the $9 breakfast and grab some yogurt for a dollar. Near the museums and a short walk to the downtown Circle Center Mall. Take a walk on the nearby canal. Skip the $17 parking charge and park on the street (no charge on weekends). Rooms a little noisy (I could sometimes hear the neighbors). Overall, highly recommended (Note: There is a newer Courtyard near the Capitol on Washington--this review is of the older Courtyard on Senate Avenue.

Where it is not so useful is when guests decide to use it as a form of vengeance, particularly when it is the first time a venue has been made aware of a complaint. Whilst I agree that Manly is a bustling place and our particular location is very close to Manly Wharf and its transport connections, suggesting that buses leave every minute 24 hours a day is inaccurate and misleading. Next time (not that it will be here by the looks of things) try and talk to the venue about your complaint while you are still there.

Their hospitality was charming too - unobtrusive, but always had time to help one.

We heard housekeeping leave the adjoining room, and yet no one came for over an hour. We finally went to the front desk, and at 7:45 we were told, oh yes, it is ready. To top it off, when we got home for the weekend, there was a message on our HOME phone that the room was ready. What was the point of giving my cell number and email address?? There was clearly not enough housekeeping staff. The restaurant was ""out"" of a lot of menu items and the latte machine was broken (and we were told it probably wouldn't get fixed). The pools were so highly chlorinated, both kids broke out in hot, burning rashes on their legs.

3165768,Hotel,5,PollyAnnie,JohnPette,"Excellent venue - staff super super super amazing! ---SEP--- Recently attended a wedding held at the Fairlawns and it was the first time both my husband and I had ever been there - it was brilliant! The venue is stunning, food excellent and the staff... well I don‚Äôt like to use the word perfect very often (mainly because perfect seems so final, and let‚Äôs face it, is there anything in this world really that could not be made even a little bit better!?) but these guys and gals are as close to perfect as you can find! I have been to many wedding's held in hotel's and with work I stay in a lot of hotels all over the country yet this is the first time I have thought so highly of the venue/staff that I wanted to write a positive review. Ideal wedding venue as it has all the romance and charm required to set a great atmosphere. The layout also means that you still feel like you are having your own private celebrations even though there are other people using the hotel too. The same room was used to go from day to night and they did this in such quick time it did not interfere with the flow of the day one bit! The food was fantastic, proper food in decent portion sizes... was pretty stuffed by the end of our 4 course wedding breakfast! I didn‚Äôt have any evening buffet but there were many compliments from other guests that did. Our room was just what we needed for the overnight stay (bed a little hard but that maybe because I have a memory foam mattress at home - so hardly really the fault of the hotel!) The following day after the wedding there was a few of us girls that spent a good few hours around the spa. It never seemed overcrowded and the facilities are excellent! Will definitely look to book to go back and hopefully enjoy a bit more time in the spa as well as book some treatments. Finally the whole reason why I wanted to write this review - the staff. I have been to many a hotel where the staff are very professional but just don‚Äôt seem that happy to be there... I would find it unbelievable for anyone to say that about the Fairlawns. Ultra professional, polite, discreet, accommodating and happy! Friendly smiles all day, nothing was too much trouble and when chatting to them it all felt very genuine which was the icing on the cake! Wonderful experience, I would stay here again and recommend to others. I am sure that there are improvements and sometimes things don‚Äôt go to plan and are not perfect however I really believe that if you find too many faults with this place then you are probably trying your hardest to find some!",Both this review and the email you were so kind as to send me personally are really appreciated. To be chosen by a couple to be the venue for both their marriage and reception is a very great compliment and to read that we also succeeded in delighting their guests really is cream on the cake.

I'am aware every organisation has rules and I do respect that but common sense isn't always applied and people tend to be rigid on straight forward things. I'm happy to say I was so impressed with the level of service given to me by the manager who was on duty on the 18th October 2019. My husband booked the room, my 2 daughters and I got there before him, the young lady at reception told me unfortunately I would have to pay first before I was checked in , unfortunately I did not have the money and my husband would only be off work later that day, I tried calling him but understandably he did not have his phone on him. I then asked for the manager and explained the kids and I have been on the road from Scotland since early hours of the morning and where very tired and would like to settle in our rooms, i promised to pay the bill the minute he would get there , I know it wasn't her problem that we didn't realise giving card details when we booked did not mean we had paid but instead she said she would let us into the room and to please pay before end of the day, she noticed I was getting stressed and tried to calm me down, I did appreciate that sort of service because nowadays people fail to see the bigger picture and just stick to what they've been trained to do and no common sense is applied whatsoever.

3317064,Hotel,5,DubaiDoug,Paul G,"Wedding reception ---SEP--- Just attended a wedding reception yesterday here at this hotel and feel the need to review it as it was just a great experience all round. From the minute we arrived and were served tea, coffee, tiny scones and homemade biscuits with attending musicians in the foyer bar it was just top notch service. Also then provided hors d'oeuvres which were very good. The actual wedding dinner showed how despite having to cater for about 230 guests, you can still serve piping hot, quality food to this large number. You only do that with a great team who work together and are well trained and managed. The menu was a large puff pastry case with chicken which was very nice, a soup that was perfect, followed by a choice of cod or beef medallions. That is the only point of criticism I would have in that, in Ireland a large number of folk like their meat well done and this was well done! The meat was great quality so flavor was still there but you can't taste that quality fully if its more than medium rare or medium! The plate had two large medallions and lot of extras and staff were round with seconds if you wished. There was a desert, then tea and coffee. Then had a traditional ceilidh band and yet more food with super sandwiches and cocktail sausages etc. God help us if we went hungry for more than two hours! Recommend this hotel for special occasions whether wedding, confirmations or just a special celebration. Well done to the management and staff for making the bride and groom plus all the attending guests day so memorable.","Good Afternoon DubaiDoug, Thank you for your wonderful review of your recent wedding experience with us.

That was one of the great factors why we chose this hotel, the great view from the rooftop. We came back earlier from our visits on Saturday specially to enjoy a coktail on the terrace but it was privatized for a teenagers party ! I mentioned this trouble at the reception and they all totaly understood the fact that I was unhappy but they said they could not do anything with the strategy of the hotel. I think that the hotel should have at least offered a drink to the customers at the ground floor bar (even if it's not the same at all...) but in our case there was no effort at all so this experience takes off 1 star. Sorry for that but there was a serious lack of communication with your customers !

On the Friday evening we ate in the carvery which was fine but the highlight was our Saturday night meal in the restaurant. The food was really lovely but it was the standard of customer service which really stood out. The place was buzzing, with large family groups as well as tables of two, four and six but the staff operated with the efficiency of a well oiled machine and with genuine warmth and friendliness. In fact that was our experience throughout the whole weekend. Every time we met a staff member in the bar, reception or simply walking in the corridor they made eye contact, smiled and greeted us. It's small things like this that make a big difference - other hotels take note. Our package included a return Viking cruise to Athlone with Michael, a fantastic guide, whose knowledge of, and passion for the lake and it's history and geography made for a great journey. Did I mention it rained for the entire weekend? Ordinarily that would have cast a shadow over the break but our experience in the Hodson Bay more than made up for the weather. No, I'm not employed by the hotel or in any way connected to anyone who works there just somebody who appreciates good food and great customer service.

Tis allowed us use of the lounge. The snacks were nice,modest. The breakfast was pleasant light. However at night you had to pay for your wine beer etc. now we paid $800 per night for our rooms we had 3 so this was not cheap.

This was super easy even with an 8mth old in a stroller. Very convenient and no stress about finding parking downtown. -Easy check out from t.v. in room and we were able to see our bill at anytime using the t.v. Cons -Elevators can be slow and are old. The south wing elevator smelled like propane a lot of the time when catching it from the 4th floor. -Super expensive movie rentals. One movie was 16.99!! That is more than going to the movie theatre to see a 3D movie. They did have some for 4.99 but nothing we wanted to see. -Carpet is a bit dated The Room: Pros -Good view (room 479) -Clean -Close to spa/pool -Had two sinks -They brought a playpen for our daughter to sleep in and it was clean and in good condition -In room safe to put valuables Cons -Was cold until we figured out how to turn off the fan that was blowing cold air onto the bed. Once the fan was off it was a little hot but we just turned the fan back on to cool it off a bit. -One of our sinks wouldn't drain -Bathroom is small and the shower head was lower than expected but these weren't that much of an issue Pool: Pros -Easy access -Good hours of service -Pool was a little cold when we went around 8pm but seemed warmer the next morning when we went around 10am -Not crowded (Not sure how it would be during high season or weekends. We went mid week and there were only 2 other people swimming) Cons -As stated above pool felt a little cold when swimming after 8pm -A little small if it had been busy Restaurants: Primrose -It was closed when we were there but the food was being served at the Larkspur. We ordered the Chicken Pesto pasta and it was absolutely terrible. It was ridiculously over priced and we were very disappointed! -We also ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was basically just cold milk. It didn't taste like chocolate and was a very thin consistency and not worth the $8.00 charge. Larkspur -Excellent food (we had the Rimrock burger and it was absolutely delicious). The fries were excellent as well -Good service and beautiful view -Food was well priced, about the same cost as eating at an Earls Traveling with an 8month old to this hotel: Pros -Restaurant and staff were helpful with the baby (playpen for baby to sleep in provided and they had high chairs/booster seats at the restaurant) -Parking was heated and underground which helped with the cold weather -Baby was able to use the pool -In hotel convenience store if you need to purchase items -Fridge in room to put baby food and formula in -Walking distance to the Gondola and the Hot Springs. We didn't have to spend time strapping the baby into her carseat to get to the hot springs. We just put her in her stroller and we were there in less than 10 minutes. Cons -Finding a bathroom to change baby in. The Primrose had a very nice bathroom with a change table. However, the night that it was closed I had difficulty finding a washroom with a change table. I ended up having to change my baby on the floor of the washroom. We would definitely stay at this hotel with our baby again! I was worried about how far from downtown Banff it was with a baby. However, with the free bus pass provided and the bus stop right outside the hotel door it was super easy.

3315783,Hotel,5,pjmacnoid,Matthew W,"Would DEFINITELY stay here again! ---SEP--- I was very happy with my stay at Microtel! We usually stay at another hotel in Colorado Springs when we vacation in Colorado, but I saw the ad in the AAA book for this one, and they had a fantastic special going on! We got the room for $40 less per night than the other hotel, plus it was listed as brand new! It was VERY nice. Large room, with bed area separated from sitting area by a kitchen type open countertop; which had fridge and microwave and SINK ; sitting area had sofa,coffeetable, plus another square table with chairs. In the bed area, there was a nice size computer desk; and the window had a large cushioned windowseat that could be used for a bed. Behind the bed the wall was mirrorred...made the room feel bigger! There were nightstands built into the wall on either side of bed. TV was OK....was high up on wall (not a flatscreen) and could be seen from bed or couch, although was more between both instead of in front of one or the other. We rarely turn on TV when we are on vacation...so not an issue! Very quiet in room, nice BR. Very clean. Staff nice and helpful...recommended eating at Texas T Bone, which was not too far, and VERY good! Breakfast was ok...had wafflemaker, usual toast/cereals/pastries, hard boiled eggs, etc They set up extra tables in lobby for breakfast; not a huge area, but more than some. Didn't use the pool; it wasn't very big as I recall, but looked clean. We will stay here again!!",Thank-you so much for staying with us and we appreciate your review on Tripadvisor!

3184880,Hotel,2,Derr0,Dave E,"Pretty ordinary ---SEP--- I would rate this as a 3 star motel - hardly the four star hotel as indicated on some sites. I suppose you expect the loud highway noise, but as others have said, you also get the noise from adjacent rooms with thin walls. Taxi charged $20 from domestic airport - hard to find entrance among all the roadworks. No shuttle available. Nose is assaulted by the strong chemical cleaning fluid/deodorant. Despite many reviewers objecting to this, the management replies that 'one of these improvements is the way we present our apartments for each guest arrival with the use of cleaning chemicals and deodorisers.' Why don't they listen to customers? I spent 15 minutes trying to get the TV to work (not helped by inaccurate information in guestbook) and then nearly an hour trying to get a connection to the internet (no wifi) - broken cable, new cable didn't connect - finally advised by reception that it didn't work with Macs. (A notice to this effect would alleviate the frustration of Mac users.) No decent food nearby (Chinese restaurant across the road if you want to brave the non-stop traffic and roadworks). 15"" pizza delivered for $31 plus $2.60 for extra toppings plus $5 delivery fee. Breakfast pack (packet of cereal, quarter-size muesli bar, tub of tinned fruit, small juice carton) for $11. Adequate kitchenette (if you have a car to go and find groceries). Bathroom large enough, but only because there is no vanity (just a tiny hand basin - where do guests put wash bag, cosmetics bag, etc?) and no shower recess (the shower is enclosed only by a shower curtain, spilling into the bathroom floor). Slippery tiles in shower. Cheap bathroom fittings. Toilet didn't flush. No wardrobe (just clothes rack). Skimpy pillows and hard mattress. At least I was given a ground floor room to save me from struggling up the stairs with two suitcases. Yes, it's close to the airport - but might be worth paying a bit more for a taxi or shuttle to somewhere else.","Thanks for your comments. At Best Western Ascot we pride ourselves in excellent customer service and clean rooms.

3217391,Hotel,3,Tedman32,Northgate,"Not impressed ---SEP--- Booked one of the apartments that had 2 Queens and 1 single which was sufficient for our needs. Arrived to be told we had been upgraded to the ""really nice"" apartment that had 1 King, 1 Queen and 1 single. Awesome and off we went with our directions to the apartment which is just behind the Motor Lodge. We were told that the apartments don't look much from the outside. Boy, that was accurate. First impressions....council units coupled with what looked like permanent residents, albeit unobtrusive and quiet residents. Walked through the front door to be greeted by sodden carpet which we had to walk through for 2 days. It looked like the shower had overflowed from the previous user and leaked through to the next room. Cleaners had obviously tried to soak the excess up but was still very very wet. Couldn't avoid walking through it as it covered a large area between the front door and the lounge. Am surprised that Management allowed the apartment to be let out actually especially considering the over inflated pricing. Apartments are spacious and reasonably clean but cleaners really need to address the spiders on the ceilings. Had a rather largish spider trying to climb into my luggage! Flies were another problem. Yes I concede flies are particularly bad at this time of the year but a can of fly spray in the kitchen cupboard would have been helpful. Last negative....only 1 small mirror above the bathroom vanity to share with potentially 5 people. Please consider putting a full length mirror in at least one of the bedrooms or hallway. We were attending a funeral and 4 people trying to get ready was a shambles. Was quiet enough though so we did sleep well. I will most definitely be looking at other options next time however. I wonder what the apartment was like that we were ""upgraded"" from.","Hello, thankyou for your review. Well we are so sorry that the upgrade was not appreciated as we thought it might have been.

Without exception the staff were lovely and went out of their way to help in every way. As I was on a coach trip we all had to eat at 6.30 and had a limited menu.

3288045,Hotel,2,Tracey M,Bayvil,"Very Disappointed ---SEP--- Had booked a 4 night stay Our accommodation turned out to be Room 41 which was a 2 bed/2 bathroom apartment above the site offices and Thai restaurant. Room 1 was ensuite showe/bath and toilet and Room 2 had a bathroom next to it with a shower and toilet. Upon arrival at the resort first impressions were good at first but once we were directed to the access to the apartment things changed. We were shown to the back door ie the service area, where the stairs to our door were in between the public toilets and then on the other side next to the back of a Thai restaurant which was spilling over on to the path which was badly hidden by a very big palm in a pot, shelves stacked with pans and boxes and 3 Coles shopping trolleys and a bicycle and the ground was covered in grease stains, not a good impression. Upon entering the foyer had a bad smell. We then entered the apartment. We were surprised as to how small it was and the condition of the walls was a bit shocking, in need of a well overdue paint job, the areas that had been patched were badly done. Only air conditioning in one bedroom and lounge area none in the other bedroom however there was a fan in the cupboard. The 2nd bathroom shower leaked water all over the floor obviously a fault with the seal. When mentioned to the caretaker she stated it always happens and would we like some more towels to mop it up! The other bathroom faired worse as it was a plastic shower hose over the bath which just would not work properly. As soon as you got hot water it went cold and vice versa , no amount of adjusting made it work properly, it was impossible to have a bath as the water flow was so slow it would have taken the whole night to fill the bath . The shower curtain was just that bit too small to reach the side of the bath so water just poured out all over the floor. The laundry line over the bath was hanging down the wall and the unit was actually hanging off the wall and it was unusable as you could not pull it out and looked tardy. The toilet cistern once flushed just did not stop filling up and the water was running continuously. Regarding the cleanliness the cupboards were badly smeared and the bedroom wardrobe and shelves had a layer of dust in the bottom as well as the mirrors were badly smeared. The curtain rail was hanging off the wall on the right hand side as the fitting was missing, all the the ropes and buttons on the Venetian blinds were dirty and majority of the knobs were broken. The pool was dated and old and the water was dirty and cold. We brought all this to the attention to the management who said they would deal with it all, but by the time we returned only the toilet had been fixed. To cap it all off on the morning of our third day at 6:15am, a massive lorry pulled up outside our side wall and kept running its engine until 09:30, so loud it impossible to sleep and filling the appartement with toxic fumes. At 9 am I went to the office and expressed my annoyance at the lorry to which I was told that it was not their problem as it was next door! I explained that least they could do is have a word and that surely they must have had warning! They said that only three days before had they been informed that these works would start and can you believe for 18 months, building a 5 storey hotel! They agreed that the lorry should not have started work until 7 am as agreed by the coyncil but they were not prepared to do anything about it ! Basically tough ! She explained that we only had one night left so it would be ok !!, I DESPAIR! These people have no idea of what customer service is, in the end I wanted to know how we stood if we left that morning could we get our money back and she said they would contact the owners but were hesitant to contact them as if asked the owners to do something that they would get in trouble! Eventually however they agreed to refund the last night and we checked out. The accommodation cost $1440 for 4 nights ! Please be aware that here on in anyone who is offered this room should refuse it or stay elsewhere, they need to invest into the apartment and bear in mind the fact that there will be building works for 18 months right next door. The only good thing the place had going for it was the location as it was central to the shops. From the discussion we had and reading the past reviews and responses from management on Trip Advisor, It would appear that management have lost their grip on reality as the responses we and other people got, were just unacceptable.",Dear Guests The unit style booked was the unit style as selected by yourselves.

My kids and I stayed over the New Years Eve (a few days before and a day after. It was also my son's sixth birthday. We were a bit under the weather when we arrived and they'd put three gingerales in our fridge. I had requested and was accommodated with a room with a view of the Norwesters. We upgraded to the family suite for New Years and also rented the steam bath. The room and the steam bath were just amazing. We had our own balcony and a view of the stars and mountains. It was exactly as I remembered growing up and wanted my kids near those mountains for the holidays. I would definitely come back again. The food at the restaurant was well priced and fresh. The pickerel was delicious. The hotel caters well to children and they felt right at home. I used to travel for a living and have stayed in four and five star hotels around the world. I was given the most personalized and considerate service I can ever remember. Thank you for making our stay so memorable. The kids learned that when staying out we respect our environment the same as if we were at home. It was a stress free holiday and although it was too cold at -50 Celsius to ski we were very cozy in the pool, jacuzzi, sauna, pool and steambath. We were able to recharge and get back to my Finn- Swede roots.","Dear Keldanhen, Thank you for giving the opportunity to provide you with a memorable stay and to recharge and get back to your Finn-Swede roots!

The hotel was presented well, the rooms were nice and breakfast was excellent. The staff member that dealt with us at the desk was not fantastic though, we had booked as a couple (on our honeymoon) but unfortunately he put us in a twin room instead of a king. We queried this explaining that we didn't want separate beds especially since we had our young child with us who may end up in our bed if she woke during the night. The staff member didn't seem to see the problem and told us that there were no other rooms.

3170133,Hotel,3,JimJ321,Kirsten D,"Beautiful Property, Sub-Par Service ---SEP--- .I will start this review by saying that both the Palazzo and attached Venetian are beautiful, well-appointed resort/casinos. They have a huge amount of amenities that rival anywhere else in Vegas. Resort: Large and centrally located on the strip. Rooms: All suites, but you can upgrade or tip at the front desk for bigger room or better view. Service: In my experience it was poor. A few main complaints: no wi-fi in room despite being charged resort fee which included this (they removed resort fee upon learning this on checkout). Room was asked to be cleaned at 9am...we asked for them to come back at 10, but they never did all day. Room service was spotty at times, one breakfast was great and one time i ordered late night it didn't show up for almost 2 hours. Casino: Good selection of tables (starting at $15 from what I saw), nice variety of slots and a cool sportsbook, but that is off the main casino downstairs. Dining: Very good! We had brunch at Morel's one day and loved it. Grand Lux was good for lunch on the day of our departure and probably the best value I saw in Vegas. Pool: We went a cabana at Azure one day and it was cool. Was it worth the minimum $1500 spend when a bottle of Absolut is worth $400? Well, I suppose that matters what you are interested in. Being married and in my thirties it didn't really justify the cost for our group to me. Shopping: A lot of high end stores. In retrospect it was probably good we spent the day at Azure otherwise my wife my have done more damage in the shopping area. Price: On par with any of the other new, luxury properties on the strip. Overall, I would stay here again, but I left with a little sour taste based on the service portion. Granted i am used to staying at smaller Hiltons on a weekly basis where good service is standard. This is a 7000 or so room resort with a focus on gaming, so I understand that me wanting to check my ipad isn't high on their priority list","Dear Guest, Thank you for choosing The Venetian|The Palazzo as your host during your recent visit.

The hotel is at the end of the main street away from the shops and eateries. The room was comfortable and quiet. Four star with fine dining the hotel is not! We ate in on our first night. The restaurant has little character or ambiance. The unsmiling waitress kept pushing her hair behind her ears as she served. Food is pretty average, although with fancy descriptions. One day on our return to the hotel at 16:30 our room had yet to be serviced. The floor supervisor pointed out that they had been busy.

This was not my first time at the Roxy (formerly the Tribeca Grand) and everything was as wonderful as I remembered. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating, always smiling and going out of their way to make guests feel valued. You can't help but feel appreciated here. I forgot my phone charger and the front desk was quick to find one for me. My very early arrival was accommodated with very little delay (just long enough to get a coffee in the excellent lobby coffee bar, Jack's,). I requested a few extra things up to the room and they brought everything up within 10 minutes of my calls (frequent travelers will know how astonishing this is). Our multiple experiences in the lobby bar were memorable (special shout-out to Roland who kept us entertained on a slow Sunday night and made us feel like VIPs). Beyond the confines of the hotel, you cannot beat the location and the surrounding offerings. There is a wealth of shopping and dining options in the immediate vicinity; the A/C/E subway is literally at the corner of the hotel and many other lines are nearby; and you can easily walk to many attractions including the Brooklyn Bridge, the World Trade Center, the ferry ports, museums, parks, etc. We did have one hiccup at the Django (waited a very long time but never received our food, couldn't find any staff to help, and had to eventually abandon our table to search out food elsewhere) but the front desk corrected this error immediately. And even though the lobby bar had technically stopped serving food, they brought out some fries and drinks to help sate our hunger. Despite this one problem, I would still try the Django again as the atmosphere is lively and the music is great. I feel certain this is not a common occurrence and was an aberration. The hotel has a cool, vintage vibe and a spacious, atrium-style lobby that is perfect for hanging out with others. The rooms are standard sized for NYC but are well-appointed, as are the bathrooms. One recommendation if you are a light-sleeper is to bring soft earplugs, as this is a low-rise hotel and you will definitely hear street noise. And you may also hear the live music from the lobby since its an atrium-style hotel. But please don't let this scare you away. I'm an extremely noise-sensitive person and quite particular about my hotel needs, and I think this hotel makes for a wonderful stay. A little preparation with earplugs goes a long way.","Dear ginaing, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay at The Roxy on TripAdvisor.

However we left feeling nothing but relaxed. We were greeted by staff of the spa and were told that the treatment we were having was a back, shoulder and neck massage. I queried this as we had been told that our treatment was a full body aromatherapy massage on the phone previously, this being why we had chose the deal. The staff member then said that we were right and we had been upgraded. When our treatment time came we had the same miscommunication problem. It was thought that we had the shoulder, back and neck massage instead of the full body one. We were then told by staff that they would massage the back of our legs for this inconvenience. Whilst in treatment my massage was extremely disappointing, I would go as far as to say the worst I have ever had. The pressure was not ok throughout and I was not asked once if it was. The treatment also did not last for the full 40 minutes as promised and the back of my legs were not massaged. After the treatment we then proceeded to the bar for some cocktails. We waited an extensive amount of time to become acknowledged by the bar staff. Then they proceeded to serve a gentlemen who had not been waiting as long as we had. When we had finally been served we went and sat within the bar area. It took 20 minutes for one cocktail to be brought to us, this I thought was very peculiar as we had ordered three. Another 10-15 minutes went by and we received the other two. I understand that this was a Saturday and you are very busy, however I was extremely disappointed with the service received both in the spa and bar facilities.

3247253,Hotel,5,Laudieevans,danmurph,Will definitely be back! ---SEP--- I recently stayed for 2 nights with my boyfriend in the Galway Bay hotel and I have to say it was a pleasure from start to finish. From the welcoming atmosphere to the excellent service by all the staff it seemed no request was too big. Our room was spacious and very clean and the view of the Promenade from our room was lovely and meant we got a good nights sleep also. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first evening and we couldn't find fault with either the quality of the food or value for money! The manager Peter was accommodating and answered all of our queries and requests in a professional and friendly manner. The hotel is close to the town without giving you the feeling that you're on a city break due to its seaside location. Highly recommend!,"Dear Guest, Thank you very much for this wonderful review of the Galway Bay Hotel. I am delighted to view your comments, and I have shared your views with all on the team. All team members here have asked that I pass on a very sincere Galway Bay Hotel ‚Äòthank you.‚Äô You mention Peter in person, he is chuffed (and rightly so) to be mentioned in such a positive light through such a public medium. I do agree with your comments regarding our location. We are very close to the city centre, however in a seaside location so people can ‚Äòget the best of both worlds‚Äô whilst relaxing during a well earned break. Also, we are in the ideal location to base oneself when choosing a location to tour the West of Ireland and Connemara; sitting directly on the promenade, overlooking the beautiful Galway Bay and Clare Hills, with Galway city on one side and of course Connemara on the other side. As you are only too aware we have the blue flag beach outside our door and this is obviously extremely popular with families and couples alike. You mention ‚Äòwelcoming atmosphere‚Äô and I am delighted to see this. As a team, we work very hard to achieve this through our in house structured training program ‚Äì ‚ÄòExceeding Expectations‚Äô ‚Äì with a primary focus on costumer care and costumer service.

3215840,Hotel,3,Katecz,ClarionHotelLimerick,"Average hotel, above average service ---SEP--- I booked this hotel for a business trip to Limerick and after reading the rapturous reviews on here, thought that I'd got an amazing deal for a twin room for two nights for GBP 120 (I think I booked on Expedia or booking.com). There are a couple of things I hadn't realised when I booked it (perhaps I hadn't read the reviews quite closely enough)...Limerick is not a particularly lovely place - I had an image of quite a quaint Irish town for some reason, but quaint it is not. The hotel is located in a particularly unscenic part of town, opposite an apartment building that is really not very nice and overlooking the river which is just generally grey. There is no parking on site and so you have to park in the NCP just around the corner - if you're staying for any longer than one night, it is better value to pay EUR 15 for a one week ticket which will allow you to come and go as you please. However there is a big positive about this hotel. The staff. They were great, without exception. Friendly, efficient check in. Lovely waitress in Kudos, the bar/restaurant. Really polite guy in the morning who quickly brought extra towels to the room when I called down for them and then helped me with some heavy parcels into my car. They really can't do enough for you and make this average hotel really good. The room could do with a make over...the beds were fine - comfortable with clean bedding and nice pillows. The carpet and curtains have seen better days though and the paintwork is a bit sad. The bathroom is ok, but on the first morning the shower was rubbish - absolutely no water pressure and lots of air, but the guy who came and brought the towels reported it to maintenance and when I came back to the room in the evening, it was completely different - really good pressure and really hot. Brilliant. My mum accompanied me (like I said, we thought Limerick was a nice place that she might like to have a look round while I was working) and she used the sauna and steam room, which she said were nice. Finally, our room number was 402. Don't ask for this room unless you particularly want a perfect view of a car wrecking yard. Work seemed to go on until about 5.30pm so isn't a big disturbance, but it's quite noisy when it is going on. On the plus side, the sunset over the river was fabulous. There we are, finished on a positive note!","Thank you for your review. The hotel is located in the city on the river Shannon (the longest river in Ireland), there is a local working dock beside us and I am glad to hear that it did not cause you too much disturbance. Many of our guests like this area as the dock has some great history attached to it, we even have some information on this in our bedrooms. I am delighted that you found our hotel team very friendly and that this was a huge positive to your trip. The sunset on the river is indeed a beautiful site and should be on everybody‚Äôs to do list when they visit. Should you be visiting this area again, I would appreciate if you contact me directly.

3162698,Hotel,1,Hotel_Inspector_HK,BathGuestServiceMgr,"Severe sting in the tail ---SEP--- Stayed here for one night with family. Booked three rooms. Priority Pass member of twenty years. Hotel is ok and of a standard you would expect for a Holiday Inn property. Clean. Quiet. Comfortable. Unfortunately this hotel (really a motel, as it doesn't provide full hotel services e.g. no meals other than breakfast, no fridge in the room etc.) is a poor advertisement for the Holiday Inn brand, very much let down by poor staff attention to detail. To explain: Upon arrival early evening, we checked into the motel having pre-paid via a third party internet booking agency. The promise was good - free broadband, free breakfast etc. etc. During the check-in procedure we were asked if we has a vehicle in the car park. We did, and we provided the staff with the registration number and felt comfortable that the hotel was aware of our (rental) vehicle, given that the car park is for exclusive use of guests we were ""in the system"". Good. All went well. The next day we prepared for check-out. I was busy packing numerous suitcases into our vehicle and my wife attended to the check-out formalities. She was advised by the hotel staff that everything was in order in relation to our account and she was advised we were ""good to go"" or something to that effect. What a surprise a couple of weeks later when I checked my credit card account to find a GBP102.00 charge from the rental car company. Turns out the vehicle had been ""ticketed"" with a fine of GBP60 (plus rental car company GBP42 service charge to process the fine) for unpaid parking charges at Holiday Inn Bath. Incredible! I have researched and found that (a) there are signs that advise of the overnight parking charge, however the details are listed below the warning that the car park is for guests only. The impression is that an overnight charge applies to deter local non-guest cars from parking there, but no worry we had registered our car at reception (b) how do guests pay the charge? Do the staff collect at reception, and if so why wasn't this issue raised with us during the check-in procedure? (c) if there's some other way to pay the fee, surely the very least the staff could do is remind guests to pay the fee, especially as we had provided details that we had a car in the car park. Such a small service would cost the motel nothing and be well appreciated by guests! There is clearly a lack of customer service ethic. To add insult to injury, after reading other Trip Advisor comments, it appears there is discretion to waive the overnight car park fee. I wonder how one qualifies for a waiver? Further, only the ""free this"" and ""free that"" are advertised on the booking web site, no mention that this is one of the only motels I've stayed at globally that charges guests for parking (with perhaps the exception of big city centre hotels). On reflection, I'm not sure how we fell through the cracks and earned such an expense, but it leaves a baste taste and I will not stay at this property in future and will not recommend others to do so. No doubt the motel will have a glossy explanation - it won't help me. I suggest the management try a spot of staff training on the ways they can make their guests have a more pleasant stay without any stings in the tail. After all, they have a global brand to protect. One more point: The motel has a small area stocked with drinks, snacks, pre-cooked meals etc. If you don't want to pay the motel's inflated prices, walk across the road to the petrol station (one minute) where you can get the same products in the convenience store for around a quarter of the price. Why don't hotels/motels get the message and just charge reasonable prices for their incidental products - they'd sell a lot more product and generate more revenue based on quantity of sales? I have only ever found one hotel (in Asia) that charged 7/11 prices in their mini-bar - their revenue increased 10-fold!","Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay. I would like to thank you for your loyalty within the Intercontinental Hotel Group, I am so pleased to hear that you've been a Priority Club member for such a long time. I am so glad to hear that you found the hotel to be clean, quiet and comfortable. Our housekeeping team do work extremely hard to maintain a high level of cleanliness and comfort throughout the hotel for our guests. As we are a Holiday Inn Express hotel, we are not full service, as you mentioned, so are only able to provide the free, hot option breakfast. However, we do provide pizzas in the evenings for our guests, which can be ordered at the bar for guests to sit in the dinning room and eat, or take back up to their room if they wish. I am so sorry to hear that you received a parking fine while staying with us, I do apologise for this. As guests enter the car park, there is a company called ParkingEye who will take a picture of the vehicle registration plate, and if this isn't registered in the terminals at reception, it will issue an automatic fine when the vehicle exits the car park. I am sorry that the member of staff checking yourself in didn't make you aware that you needed to register your vehicle in the terminal, I am extremely disappointed to hear this happened and will be discussing this with the team. Our car park is for guests only, which is why we have the ParkingEye system in place, there are signs throughout the car park informing people entering the car park, that their vehicle registration number needs to be registered. We do try to take the car parking charge of ¬£8 a night upon check in, although some guests choose to pay on check out for this. Guests pay at reception for this, as the parking charge is added to the bill. There was obviously some confusion with your parking charge not being applied to your bill, and the vehicle not being registered, so I sincerely apologise that this happened. As you have already paid for this parking fine through the rental company, if you contact the hotel, either by email; info@expressbath.co.uk, or telephone; 01225 303000, with the parking reference number, and your vehicle registration number that appears on the ParkingEye fine, we are more than happy to contact ParkingEye and get this fine refunded and cancelled for yourself, as well as contacting the car rental company for you. I would like to apologise again, for this confusion and inconvenience, and thank you for taking the time to write a review, it is feedback such as yours which enables us to see how we are doing, and what areas we can improve on in the future.

3315227,Hotel,5,sabinafire,Kevin R,"A Sweet Escape ---SEP--- Last weekend my husband and I threw a dinner party for some friends at The Standard Hotel. We live in NYC, but decided to have a staycation at The Standard, as our friends were coming from out of town, and I had made arrangements for them to room there. As I pulled up in my taxi from a long Saturday at the office, I instantly felt transported and ready for an exciting evening. The reception had a Swiss Chalet vibe- warm and inviting lounge area at the entrance- mix of well dressed travelers, and NY locals, drinks flowing, and a great atmosphere. When I arrived to our room, my husband told me that he had taken our 11 yr old daughter skating at the Ice Rink in front of the hotel, and continued to tell me how nicely he had been treated by Paul Kashman, a Standard Exec., who had helped to arrange our weekend. Paul had our room prepared slightly earlier than expected as he saw our daughter had overexerted herself while skating, needing some R&R, and something warm to drink. A bowl of chicken soup arrived for our daughter instantly, and my husband was able to check in and enjoy the rest of the afternoon. When our friends arrived in the evening- we proceeded to a lovely dinner at The Standard Grill, and after party at Top of The Standard. The evening fantastically executed - no stone left unturned. The view and decor at Top of The Standard is truly spectacular, one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC. (A must see even for a New Yorker) The next morning, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise above the Hudson River- from our room's floor to ceiling windows, and amazingly comfortable bed. Great Party- Fun Staycation- Perfect Weekend!! I would definately book a weekend just like this one at The Standard again. Special thanks to Paul Kashman and Adam Fakier for their attention to detail and for such a memorable experience.","Hi Sabina Thank you for taking the time to write this incredible review and for choosing The Standard, High Line for your staycation!

3189456,Hotel,5,happercamper,luvsdelta,"My first but not my last visit ---SEP--- I thoroughly enjoyed my over-night stay at the Delta Armouries hotel in London. This property is a high rise modern hotel built inside the walls of an old Armoury in London. I am from a military family, so this was very cool to me. My Dad spoke of this Armoury many times during his military career. I finally had the opportunity to stay at the hotel & experience the Armoury, well at least the original walls. :) If you are interested in the military history of this property, there is even a mini museum on the 2nd floor. Very well done. I was extremely impressed with the excellent customer service at this hotel from customer check-in, the housekeeping staff, to check-out. I was made to feel special & welcome from the time I arrived to the time I left, even though my stay was very short. The level of professional, friendly service was exceptional. My room, recently renovated, was spacious & had everything I needed. I wish I knew the names of everyone who served me, because I would list all of them in this review. However, one name stands out from the rest. Marguerite, one of the housekeeping staff went over & above for me & provided a bath chair for the bathtub. I have some minor mobility issues, so she pleasantly suggested that she bring me this bath chair. I travel a lot for work & rarely experience this level of kindness & caring. There is a pool & a hot tub on the second floor. I mainly used the hot tub & thought it was a real treat on a cold, snowy winter Saturday in London. I had lunch & dinner at the Armouries Grille on the Saturday. The servers were extremely attentive to my food allergies. Very much appreciated. Both meals were excellent. I would highly recommend the plated roast beef which they serve on Saturday evenings. I will definitely return to the Delta Armouries Hotel in London--- for a longer visit next time. :)","Dear Happercamper, Thank you for the terrific feedback from your recent visit to our Hotel.

Craig and his family could not have done any more for us to make our stay any better. The location is perfect: close to centre of town but far enough from the noise, very near Fistral and the harbour. The accommodation is perfect for a school group, the rooms, layout, atmosphere, decor, lounge and dining space suiting our needs totally. The home cooked food is lovely, especially the 'packed lunches' and as it's home cooked was able to accommodate the various allergies and food intolerances our group contained. The service is brilliant - Craig was practically another member of our school team, helping us out, being our local tour guide, couldn‚Äôt do any more to make us feel at home and had a great manner with the students (and great fun with staff.) The Ocean Lodge is a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone. But for any schools looking for a base for their school trip to Newquay you could not find a better stay than here.

I booked the inn through a package on Dollywood.com. I liked the proximity to Dollywood AND to many restaurants that would appeal to my family (7 and 8 year old)...again, we wanted to spend our time wisely and not sit in traffic. EVERYTHING was on target with this inn. Check in/out was fast, room was clean/smelled clean, bedding/bed were very comfortable, and pools/hot tub were nice and had guest towels. We had a third floor balcony over the river in the part farthest from the lobby. It was quiet and surprisingly peaceful considering the amount of cars near us...you would never know! The breakfast was really good with lots of options. It was crowded but kudos to the employees and the hostess...food was hot and quickly restocked and seating was pretty plentiful. Here is the one place for improvement-3 to 4 more tables would be better...especially on the patio which looked like it could accommodate a bit more. Free popcorn and hot chocolate in the evenings were fun for the kids and one night the desk was giving out goodie bags and books to kids!

3309123,Hotel,4,LittleEinNY,Ben F,"Great for Families ---SEP--- We stayed for only one night on our way back from Margaret River - me and my Husband and 2 kids. Fremantle is a lovely little town and this was a great stay for the family. I had booked a 2 bedroom apartment and was upgraded to a 3 bedroom apartment facing the marina. Pros: - Great space. The kitchen, dining and living room with tv and small balcony were on the first floor. Kitchen was well equipped for eating and cooking and had a Nespresso and dishwasher. Full washer dryer also with detergent provided. Second floor was Master bedroom with TV and ensuite bathroom with large jacuzzi. The second bedroom had 2 twin beds and there was another separate bathroom with a shower. Third floor had 2 twin beds but no bathroom. Overall rooms were a good size but not huge. It was all clean and functional - Amazing View of the marina and sunset - Beds very comfortable - Location was great. End of the marina boardwalk and walking distance to a whole bunch of seafood restaurants and the Little Creatures Brewery. A short drive to the Fremantle Prison and also the Fremantle Market - Quick and easy check in and check out. Everything was good to go for us when we checked in. Cons: - This is a serviced apartment not a full service hotel. You can order breakfast the night before but I don‚Äôt think there was any kind of on demand room service. That said you could walk down the boardwalk in the morning to get coffee and toast at the seafood restaurants too - Bathrooms only had one sink each and the showers didn‚Äôt have the detachable showerheads, which are helpful when you have kids - The parking lot is small and tight. And yes, they clearly indicate when you make the reservation and when you check in it‚Äôs $15 so don‚Äôt be shocked when they charge you","Thank you for taking the time to write your detailed review.

3194950,Hotel,5,StPeteSaint,HyattGuestRelations,"Despite too many flaws, it's still 5 stars ---SEP--- I admit it. I'm a critical person. (Just ask my wife.) And this weekend's stay at the Grand Hyatt was far from perfect. But I'm still giving our stay 5 stars. Why? Because sometimes it's not the problem, but the solution that is important.. A few weeks ago, I was reading an online article about ""Tampa away from the beach"" or something like that, and the writer was raving about the ""casitas"" at the Grand Hyatt. Hyatt's web site really doesn't describe the casitas, so I'll try. The casitas aren't physically connected to the main hotel. They're basically large one-room units set on one of the inlets along Tampa Bay. The clean lines of modern decor makes the casita seem larger than it is. My wife and I decided to make a night of it: I booked a casita ""romance package,"" which was supposed to include free valet parking, a ""welcome"" bottle of champagne and either in-room breakfast for two or breakfast at the hotel's casual restaurant, Petey Brown's. We decided to splurge and make reservations at Oystercatchers (definitely 5 stars) for Saturday night. Oh, and the casita was ""bay side,"" which makes you think you have a water view. You'd be mostly wrong about that. Your view is mangroves, with just specks of water peeking through the mangroves. Valet, champagne, breakfast? Sounds great, right? Let's take them one by one to see where they came up short. We took advantage of the valet parking, moving our bags from our car to shuttle transportation. When we got back to the casitas, there was a large parking lot. It would've been much easier for us to have our car near us instead of back by the parking garage. When we got to the room (2018), as soon as we walked in, a distinct musty odor hit us and we asked to change room, winding up in 2036, which was an ADA room with an open shower, which really didn't bother us as much as that musty smell did. Champagne? We never did get that bottle. It was never delivered to our room after check out. When we got back from Oystercatches (about 10 p.m.), I called the front desk. They apologized and said the bottle would be delivered at 10 a.m. the next morning. We checked out about 11 a.m. with no champagne. Breakfast? Apparently, there was supposed to be some book or form in our room that explained our breakfast choices. We never had that and by the time we checked out, we were ready to leave the hotel and skip all the bother of another unfulfilled offer of breakfast. But here's the hotel's saving grace: our checkout person. When she asked about our stay, I told her how disappointed I was and listed all the problems. She asked if there was anything she could do, and I said a price adjustment would be nice and she agreed, taking $50 (the romance package) off our bill. I wish I remembered her name to give her the credit she deserves.","Dear StPeteSaint, Thank you for taking the time to share comments with us with regards to your recent stay at our hotel.

We purchased the Prestige Suite package and it is so worth the extra money. Limo to and from the airport is so much better than a cab. Check in was extremely quick and easy. The lounge is great. It has great food and drink variety. We never went anywhere else for breakfast and afternoon snacks/appetizers were excellent. My only complaint is all the cigarette smoke in the casino, but that is the case at all hotels. I would absolutely stay here again.","Dear Guest, Thank you so much for making The Palazzo your destination of choice for your Christmas holiday.

It is really confusing to know where to go, to get into the hotel for the lobby. Parking must be done by valet and it is costly - $30 - no other options. No bell service looking to help us with our bags at all. We got checked in, got our room key but folks failed to tell us that you HAVE to use your room key, to make the elevator work. Would have been nice to have known that before stressing out and having to walk the stairs with all of our luggage. Again, no one bothered to see if they could help. Our room was minuscule and it overlooked all the air conditioners. Butt ugly view and noisy with the air conditioners all going.

3322598,Hotel,5,Jenn B,EmbassySuitesDestin,"Great property, nice people - excellent experience! ---SEP--- Picked this hotel because my travel companion had about a bazillion Hilton points, so we thought ""why not go a little nicer than normal"". We were not disappointed. Hotel is technically located in Miramar Beach I believe, it's about 5 miles east of what I think of as ""Destin proper"" (i.e. all the Destin condos and touristy activities). It is conveniently located and easy to get to and from any place we wanted to go. I aslo think that maybe being away from the main tourist area was a good thing - not a huge amount of activity going on around the hotel. Don't get me wrong, the area isn't desolate, but there isn't a hotel every 10 feet either. The outside of the hotel isn't particuarly remarkable, but the inside is very nice. Having never stayed at an Embassy Suites before, maybe this was typical, but all of the rooms open onto a central atrium that was very nice and well appointed. Lots of greenery and comfortable seating in that atrium, with a glass roof to allow for a lot of natural lighting during the day. The rooms themselves are indeed ""suites"" - there s a fair-sized living area as you enter, with a sleeper sofa, an arm chair, and an ottoman, along with a ""dining"" table with 3 chairs, plus a TV on top of a cabinet that contains the safe and other extras. In the middle portion, the large bathroom is off to one side through a door (with a closet just outside the bathroom), an opposite the bathroom door is a wet bar with a coffee maker, bar sink, mini fridge, and some draws and cabinets. Finally, in the back of the suite through another door is the bedroom. We had a double queen, and the room still felt very large. In the room was an additional vanity/sink/mirror combo, plus another TV and chest of drawers, and an additional closet. The whole suite was much more than we were expecting, plenty of room for two, and a whole family of 4-6 could probably stay comfortably. The separate bedroom is definitely a good thing, as I tend to get up much earlier than my traveling companion, so I was able to get up, close the door, and then not have to worry so much about tiptoeing around the room.to avoid disturbing her. In addition to the really nice rooms, the hotel offers a very nice free breakfast buffet every morning. Good selection of hot dishes (eggs, sausage, pancakes, etc.), plus some made-to-order stuff (eggs and omelets), oatmeal, fresh fruit, cereal, baked goods, etc. It was quite a selection, especially to be included in the price of the room. There's also a ""reception"" every evening from 5:30 to 7:30 that included light snacks (chips and dip, pretzels, chips and salsa, etc.) and some alcoholic beverages (beers, a few mixed drinks, etc.). We tried to hit this every night, wanted to get our money's worth! =0) Hotel also has a private access to the beach - note that this doesn't mean ""private beach"" . . . just a hotel-specific path too the beach that is gated. It's a fairly easy walk if you are able-bodied, but it's easily 500 yards from front entrance of the hotel, across a fairly busy street, along a parking lot, up a ramp, and down about 30 stairs. I would say it is not wheelchair accessible, and if you can't walk distances or up and down stairs, you might have issues. Also not a place where parents are going to be able to send their younger kids (thinking under 13 or so) back and forth without an adult or older child along. The hotel has beach towels available for guests for no charge - get as many as you like, but you need to sign them out and in. They didn't seem to care how many you took or how often you exchanged them. They were pretty nice towels, so if you want to travel light, leave yours at home and use theirs. Once you get to the beach, it is, of course, very nice (it's Destin, after all). There are chairs and umbrella rentals available (charge to your room or pay on the spot), along with a few water sport things to rent (kayaks, paddle boards, etc.). We were very happy at the beach. Finally, I did use the fitness room for several days, as the weather wasn't great while we were there. I don't have a lot of experience with hotel fitness rooms, but this one seems very nice. It had a multi-exercise weight machine, some weighted ball and a few dumbells, plus a couple of treadmills, an elliptical, and a bike. I used the treadmills and they were extremely nice - lots of different programs, and you could watch a TV channel right on your treadmill using headphones. I only have two minor complaints - first is that the walls of the rooms seemed unusually thin for this quality of hotel. We couldn't hear exactly what the people next door were saying or watching on TV, but we could hear that they were talking and watching TV. Second would be that if you had someone sleeping on the ""hide-a-bed"" in the living room portion of the suite, they may find that the noise from the central atrium might be a little disturbing. It wasn't terrible, but there was a lot of echoing and such that you could hear through the door, and in the morning during breakfast, it was definitely noticeable in the room. Other than that, no complaints, will absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to others!",Jenn Wow what a great and detailed review of the hotel! I am glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. I am a big believer that its the staff that makes the real difference. We have so much to offer for those wanting to get away. I love the hotels location as we are so close to so much to do yet not surrounded by all of the congestion that can sometimes happen in Destin. I have always said we are 100-150 yards to the beach and happened to have a carpet cleaning contractor here and borrowed his measuring tool. From the front door of the hotel to the gate at the walkover we are 220 yards. You are correct there are several stairs that you have to go up and down to get over the dunes that protect us in case of bad weather. There is wheel chair accessible access just up the road at the access by Whales tail. I know there are motorized beach wheelchairs available for rent in the area as well. Thanks so much for staying with us and I hope when you have the chance that you come back and see us again.

3305441,Hotel,4,Mary R,SandsResort,"Well-needed family break ---SEP--- The hotel is excellent. It seems to cater well for both families and couples as there are many different dining options, room types and bar/lounge areas. This was our first ever hotel visit with 3 children and after a stressful start (baby's sleeping bag left at home), we soon relaxed. The rooms are excellent and the childrens' room has plenty of room, good sized beds and a proper door between it and the rest of the room (bathroom and parents' room). We used the childcare once and the children really enjoyed the childrens' club and wanted to go back. The pool is not particularly large but although the hotel was full, we only ever shared it with one other family. There are plenty of areas inside and outside to relax and for the children to play. It is also very close to 2 excellent beaches - Porth and Watergate Bay and you can walk from the hotel by crossing a fairly quiet road or drive a few minutes to get to the nearest. I was surprised about the negative comments about breakfast which we thought was really good and catered for just about every taste. The evening a la carte meals were excellent and we really enjoyed our childfree dinner every night (we made use of the baby listening service). There was also great live entertainment (2 local singers) on the Saturday night which we were surprised we enjoyed so much. There were a few negatives - we were given the wrong information about the breakfast time and were really irritated as we had to keep the children occupied in our room for a full hour longer than we needed to) and the fact that you have to pay to use the gym - a small thing but feels really penny pinching. But these were outweighed by the positives - great friendly staff, fantastic food, lovely rooms, great atmosphere - and we would definitely like to return.","Hi Thanks for your kind words about Sands, I'm glad that you and your family got the most from holiday. With regard to the gym we previously had a small gym with limited equipment that was free. We canvassed guests to see if they would be happy to pay for the use of a modern gym with air conditioning and the overiding response was that a ¬£10 charge for the length of the holiday was reasonable. The gym cost over ¬£100,000 to build and has high ongoing maintanance costs to keep the state of the art equipment safe, clean and up to date. Without the small charge we make we would not be able to provide such a nice gym. I hope you enjoyed the new equipment.

It was an older home built as a duplex that was renovated for the hotel use....maybe in the 1960's. Quiet and a welcome degree of solitude except one night when the upper room was a bit frisky. The inside is dated in some ways...but amazing with things like a pants press and very cool furnishings- comfortable and well taken care of. Bath sizable and well appointed. Breakfast was a good variety for buffet [not sure if real scrambled eggs] where you can assemble a full English breakfast with sausage and bacon and with extremely courteous wait staff. Desk staff especially helpful with our numerous questions and insights into local color. Small garden/sitting area in front yard screen from the street where we ate take-out from one of local places.","Thank you for this review, Yes it is real scrambled eggs - made with real fresh eggs.

Booked in for four nights this week but it was so so bad we decided to cut our losses and loose money rather than stay a single night there. Grossest shabbiest building iv been in for a long time. Listen to all the reviews on this website as they are all true and I wish we had listened. We're on honeymoon and it has ruined the start of it. The rooms are filthy and stenchey and when we sat on the bed it was lumpy and uneven. Requested to speak to manager and the man on the desks reply was : depends what its regarding. Think reception must get hundreds of complaints as they didn't seem surprised orbothered. Told the man we were checking out and he replied that they have 78 rooms and some have been renovated and some haven't. Well in my opinion they shouldn't put people in the non renovated rooms until the renovated ones are full which they cant be if they were able to move us. By this point I was too disgusted at the staffs attitudes that I just wanted to get out of there and I wouldn't have given them the time of day to give us another room. Honestly felt like we were in their way and they couldn't be bothered to listen. Cups in room looked unwashed, paint round windows all peeling off, toilet unflushed, we both felt like they needed help decorating rather than guests. If you have a mobility issue this is seriously not the hotel for you. Reception couldn't have been less helpful or less interested if they tried. So disgraceful that they even exist as a business and I would never ever step foot in there again even if u paid me. Awful awful awful!!!!","This review is histrionic and unhelpful as a result - more so as I was party to the dialogue with our manager. These so called guests did not give the hotel an opportunity to offer them an alternative and in any event, the room they had been allocated was one of our executive rooms and is always reserved by our best customer who has been visiting for years and is especially discerning The fact that alternative accommodation was booked in advance of their speaking to our manager speaks volumes.

This is a 10 floor hotel with 2 elevators and only 1 worked. Outdoor pool was closed for the season in June. Beds are hard. No table or seeting in room. The breakfast was mediocre at best and if you wanted it you needed to b early because they ran out and did not refill. On our first outing they deactivated all of our room keys and we all had to go back down to get them reset and then in my room the housekeeping staff had locked out bathroom door shut and when i called the desk the obviously foreign speaking girl did not believe me and had to come see it for herself even though she knew she did not have the key and could not fix it and then her solution was to move us to another room - what a hassle in the first place, but it still did not resolve the fact that all of our toiletries were still going to be locked in that bathroom! The next day the two rooms on the 3rd floor had to leave their rooms during the day so the plumbing could be worked on. The decor was outdated and what updates they had attempted were cheaply done. Their General Manager was extremely unprofessional and rude - One of the other guests who is my sister has a daughter whose hair is dyed a very bright red and unfortunately it bled onto the bedding leaving a pinkish discoloration and they checked out before us and the general manager told me to inform her they are billing her an additional $150 cleaning fee for it - I told her that was her job not mine and made her call her to inform her of it and then i listened to her basically call my sister a liar because she did not believe it was from hair dye.

Location a bit lacking in places to walk to for dinner or shopping but overall the area is nice. Workout room is excellent and they have a decent pool that they do keep warm (thank you). Now the buts... The coffee maker is a new item and is a disaster. It says push the lit symbol lightly... You have to mash down on it for it to work. That is if you can squeeze a coffee cup in. The coffee cups are too tall. The expression cups are okay. To get the coffe cup to fit you can remove the silver grate that the cup sits on and wedge in you cup there that should work. I also had the toilet paper holder fall off, just not my night. The retaining ring must have failed, it was okay I just rolled off the paper.

3200335,Hotel,5,surfKiev,RHCoordinator,"Best location, grand art deco style and peaceful ---SEP--- For me this place was a fantastic treat. I will first explain what makes this place great and then what some travelers may not want. The Great: First, this hotel has absolutely the BEST location on Waikiki. See on maps that the hotel is on the west end of Waikiki Bay with wide sandy beach with best viewing angle of diamond head. Any hotel to the west has little to no beach. It is also far enough off the main boulevard to be quiet and have a huge yard and entrance. Next, the grand old architecture with tall ceilings gives and airy old-world Gatsby feel. They don't build like this anymore. After 2009 remodel, most rooms are luxurious, large and high quality. Restaurant food is very good. Potential drawbacks: The pool is small which was fine for me. This fact and others means this place is not geared towards children which is also a plus for me. There are more Disney-like places to stay if you have small kids. Restaurant food is pricey, but Waikiki is not a place for bargains. Most bathrooms have been nicely updated, but some still have not been upgraded. The Moana Surfrider is two doors down and also has grand old charm. For me, the Royal Hawaiian tops this due to the more secluded feel and quiet atmosphere. The Surfrider is directly on the main boulevard and feels noisy and hectic. If you want to stay ""On the beach"" in Waikiki there are only and handful of choices and the Royal Hawaiian is the classiest, quiet and most Hawaiian feeling alternative. Other places claim to be on the beach, but there are across a very busy and touristy street. If you've got young kids maybe you should go somewhere else. If you're a couple or someone wanting to relax and chill in a beautiful surrounding, stay at the Royal Hawaiian.","Dear surfKiev, We're delighted to learn that you enjoyed an exceptional vacation with us here at The Royal Hawaiian.

3295068,Hotel,4,Pacocoz79,Taryn C,"Enjoyed our stay! Your staff could improve their customer service skills! ---SEP--- Overall, we really enjoyed our stay (4 nights). Your location is great and our room was nice and clean. For our purposes it did meet our needs! However, I believe your staff at the front desk could improve their customer service skills, specially when it is clear that English is not one's first language. Sometimes you don't feel ""welcome"" to go and request anything because they can be kind of harsh in their responses. Now, the fact that you only provide bottles of water for the first night was a bit disappointing. Some of us are not used to drinking water from the tap and, on the second night, when I requested for a bottle of water to the guy at the front desk (at night), he gave me ONE a bit hesitant. Then, on the third night he told my wife that bottles of water were for sale if we wanted more. Certainly not very friendly and the feeling of ""having to beg for a bottle of water"" was not very nice. The bottom line is that apart from that tiny detail, our stay at the hotel was ok. It did comply with our needs for our 4 night stay and if you're planning on spending your days outdoors and using the hotel only for sleeping and maybe preparing yourself a nice breakfast the next day, then this is a very good option which we would totally recommend.","Dear Guest, We are so glad that you chose to stay at our hotel - it was a pleasure to be your hosts while in Denver. Thank you for the great suggestion on the water bottles! We also appreciate the feedback on our team of associates.

There is so much to do in Branson that all we ask of a hotel is a clean bed and shower. Twelve Oaks provided that and then some. The grounds and the rooms are spotless. The staff from the front desk to the breakfast room to the grounds and housekeepers were all so friendly and polite; they definitely made us feel at home. Breakfast was tasty, with plenty of variety. The location on the west end of ""the Strip"" is perfect. The theme park is a short drive away.

3168165,Hotel,2,Lisa F,Daniel O,"Comfortable but.. ---SEP--- We stayed at the Clayton for two nights. The room was very clean and had everything you would expect from a hotel room. The bed was large and exceptionally comfortable and we were very happy with the room. Unfortunately the hotel itself was soulless. We ate there the first night in the lobby as the restaurant does not open in the evenings. The menu is very small and very expensive. It was not the romantic meal you would expect for a couples weekend as the lobby is cold and there are people coming and going. The second night we ate in the bar and this was not much better. The bar is a large empty space filled with televisions. It was so cold I had to leave my jacket on. So we retreated to the comfort of our big comfy bed, and all was well again, that is untill we where rudely awakened at about 3.20am buy what I assume was fans from the air conditioning system in the hotel? The noise filled the room and the hallway.I rang front desk to ask if this was normal and they said no and that they would send someone to look into it but we heard nothing back and we eventually fell asleep again (even with the noise). All in all we enjoyed our weekend away but I don't think we would stay at the Clayton again. For anyone who is going to park over night you can expect to pay ‚Ç¨13 a night which came as a surprise to me seeing as we spent nearly ‚Ç¨200 a night room rate, I thought parking would be included in it.","Hello Lisa F, Just messaging you back to say thank you for your time spent reviewing our Hotel and a special thank you for your kind scoring you gave while filling out the review.

Comments below: *The staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the doormen who acknowledged our comings and goings in a very welcoming - not creepy :) - way. *The room was very nice albeit small with typical Conrad features i.e. turn down, nespresso, etc. Great shower. *Wonderful Executive Lounge. The evening happy hour could have sufficed as dinner. Lounge staff did a great job. Breakfast was good, however... *Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was AMAZING. Free for Diamonds but even if I paid for it, it would have been worth it...well, maybe for one morning anyway :) Buffet options are plentiful and you can also get cooked to order. Service is attentive unlike some hotel buffets. *I liked the location. I had been a bit worried that it would be a bit too remote at night but worries were unfounded. The tube is directly across the street. There are several local bars within a block or two and a 10-15 minute walk gives you a multitude of options. *The hotel bar is open late and they have reasonably priced whiskey. The only downside of our stay I would say was that the bar staff was a bit lame. Not terrible, just not very customer-service oriented. The three nights we were in the bar there were a handful of customer there (10-15) and the bartender hung out in back rather than standing behind the bar to watch over customers. Again, nothing egregious but not exactly a welcoming feeling.","Thank you for posting this lovely and very informative review for us.

For an older hotel, built in the heyday, it is a cool place to stay. Like most hotels, it has its pros and cons but overall It is a great value. Most all of the staff are kind and courteous and on point. We had trouble with the contracted cleaning crew not allowing us to eat in the lobby during their cleaning routine. It was a group of us and we were not ready to go back to the room, we wanted to stay in a community area but the Cleaning crew did not allow us. We stayed anyway. This was at no fault of the Hotel. I would like to give a shout out to Mrs. Lee who took great care of our group and myself and made me feel at home, greeting me every day and making sure we were well taken care of, Thank you, Mrs. Lee!","Scottmbreaux, thank you for taking the time to leave us this 4 star review and for letting us know how Mrs. Lee was able to make you feel at home with us at B Ocean Resort!

3307744,Hotel,3,Vicki524,Darryl R,"Don't stay here for a relaxing spa-break ---SEP--- Just stayed two nights in the main hotel. Positives: - the breakfast was really good, lots of choice, frequently replenished and a lovely setting. Disappointments: - We stayed at the Headland as it was advertised as somewhere for a romantic and luxurious retreat, and neither of us have any issues with children running around the lounge areas, being noisy or causing a mess. However, the spa really shouldn't be for children. We planned to visit the spa Saturday morning before going out for lunch, but when we arrived the pool (which is small, fine for a spa-dip) was literally full to the brim with children and babies. Some of them were quite boisterous, play-fighting, jumping in and generally running amok. Some of the parents were sat in the ""relaxation area"" watching them through the glass. Children were also in the jacuzzi, so we couldn't even relax in there away from the main pool. When we mentioned this to the spa reception, the girl was understanding (she said it would never have been the case where she worked previously), but that the area used to be a children's play area with ball pits etc, and that the hotel was family-friendly. I really must reiterate that neither of us are anti-children in any way, but a spa is a spa, it isn't a playground. Do NOT stay here if you are expecting a relaxing spa-break, because you won't get it. The spa is child-free from 6pm...just when you want to be getting ready for an evening meal. A complete disappointment. - The hotel is very dog-friendly. Luckily, we both like dogs. What we don't really like is sitting in the lounge for a quiet drink, and being faced with a horde of barking dogs, who all seem to get upset with each other. Don't stay here if you don't like dogs, or, even worse, have an allergy. The room had dog hair all over the floor. - On arrival, we were ""upgraded"" to a tower room. Now, this is an awkward one to write, as we were told we were upgraded, and so naturally we were grateful for that. However, we booked (and paid quite a lot for!) an ocean-view room. The tower room had a view of the golf course and a building site, and if you sat on one side of the window-sill, you could peer at half a view of the coast. We discussed it a few times during our stay...on the one hand, we were told we were upgraded, on the other, we really wanted an ocean-view. We didn't really know what to do, and the room was a lovely size, so we stayed put. But do be aware of this if you really want that ocean view. In the hotel's defence, we didn't complain at the time. -The hotel suffered a power-cut during our stay. These things happen, and we understand that. However, we had no water in our room (being so high in the hotel, there must have been an electric pump or something), and so we had to traipse down the stairs to the spa and shower in the dark. I then had to go out to lunch (we booked Rick Stein's restaurant as a special treat) with wet hair. Now, this isn't a huge problem...what is a problem is the complete lack of customer service during or after this. A simple note under the door apologising for the inconvenience would have been nice, or perhaps an offer of a complimentary drink in the bar. Instead, we got complete indifference when we checked out and were asked how our stay was. When we said our stay hadn't been as relaxing or pleasant as we had hoped, the receptionist said ""oh, i'm sorry to hear about that"", and then gave us our bill. Perhaps i'm old-fashioned, but I would have tried to compensate in some way. All-in-all, the hotel was a huge disappointment. The spa, in particular, was awful and I urge any of you looking for a spa-break to look elsewhere.","Thank you for your recent review on this site, and I am aware that you used Trip Advisor as part of your decision making process when choosing to book to stay with us. It is very regrettable that you did not enjoy your stay as much as you might have, certainly you would have experienced a less than smooth check out when the local sub-station failed on the Saturday morning, Hotel bedrooms, public areas and Cottages were plunged into darkness, and additionally we lost all power to our electrical and communication systems for around two hours, thankfully there was natural daylight for many! I am sorry that you did not enjoy one of two ‚ÄôTower‚Äô rooms that we have here, they are very quirky in many respects but the one you occupied whilst furnished beautifully, definitely does not have an ocean view, if we had been aware of your dis satisfaction, I am sure we may have been able to have selected a more agreeable choice for you to consider. You were quite correct in assuming that there is an additional water pump for this room and it would have failed when we lost our power, apologies for the disruption it clearly caused prior to your check out. Newquay is very much viewed as the capital of beach holidays in this country. With seven sandy beaches, most of which are lifeguarded, fantastic water sports on offer and of course great surfing it is easy to see why! Perched above Fistral beach and surrounded by surf schools, we hope always to be inundated with families wishing to enjoy all of these outdoor pursuits and more. The Headland is the perfect spot to be staying, whether in the Hotel or opting for a Cottage self ‚Äìcatering style holiday. The Headland has already begun, and shortly after the school holidays, will be offering some of the very best experiences in Spa Breaks throughout the year; in fact we can‚Äôt wait to show everyone just how good they are planned to be! Meanwhile we will never be advertising specific packages or portraying to be the perfect choice for a relaxing spa break within a school holiday period. Best wishes for now and I genuinely hope that you might be able to visit us once again during a different time of year to experience the very best of what we will have to offer in facilities and treats!",2 -2 2,658770,The Headland Hotel & Spa - Newquay,191645,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186239-or4255-d191645-Reviews-The_Headland_Hotel_Spa_Newquay-Newquay_Cornwall_England.html,UK,test,3.4545454545454546,11,0.5181500315666199,0.0,3.758449515791175,3307744

I was in contact with the hotel 2 weeks before I actually arrived for my holiday and it was clear to me that the entire Alohilani team wanted me to have an amazing experience during my stay. I also want to state that this focus and attention to customer experience covered the entire team, from the General Manager, through to the events team, the front desk staff, the pool team, bar staff, restaurant staff etc........ I stayed at the hotel for 8 days, and everything was perfect. The hotel itself is great and has a boutique feel which is what I was looking for. Additionally the location is perfect in that you are right on Waikiki Beach and so have an easy option of chilling in the infinity pool or taking a walk across the street to the beach or even walking down to the hustle and bustle of downtown; everything is literally on your doorstep. I also had access to the Long Board Club which I would advise everyone to get. This provided me with a little exclusivity as well as breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks. The real value of the Long Board Club for me though, was the fact that if I wanted some downtime to relax or read my book, then I always had the option of walking across from the infinity pool to the Long Board Club and chilling in a cabana, which was always available. I absolutely loves this hotel and if I go back to Oahu again, I will only stay here!!! Well done Alohilani team..........great work!","Aloha Rajan D, Mahalo for choosing us.

3219703,Hotel,5,Mike,Paul D,"A wonderful place to slow down during a trip to Ireland ---SEP--- We stayed 2 nights after almost 2 weeks of a hectic but enjoyable driving holiday around Ireland. It is not really a castle compared to those in England or Scotland, it is more a large medieval manor house - it is about 200 years old and built in a medieval style. However, it is very comfortable, the staff is fantastic and the dining very good. Beautiful rooms and comfy lounge/bar area makes it a great place to unwind. Stephen in the bar made our stay particularly enjoyable. The surrounding woods and walking trails are very nice. The only thing average were the breakfasts - they offer the same Irish breakfast as anywhere else with nothing special; perhaps even fewer options than some of the smaller B&B we stayed at. This was a bit of a surprise compared to the gourmet dining in the evening.","Dear Mikecd, Thank you for taking your time to leave us feedback regarding your stay with us. It is a pleasure to hear you enjoyed your time spent here so much, I can only hope all of your time here in Ireland was as delightful. The castle is a Manor House built in medieval Neo gothic style. The building was built in 1833 and it stayed as a Manor House for many years before becoming a sanatarium and the existence of the building being threatened when the roof was to be taken off. Fortunately it was purchased by Marshall Doran in the 70's and restored to its current glory. Marshall was an avid collector of all things old and has a beautiful collection on display in our museum which we do tours of daily at 11am, 2pm and 4pm. I do hope you get a chance to enjoy our guided tour at another point in time. I am sorry however to hear you found breakfast average. We do serve a range of continental breakfast on our buffet and also our cook to order and full Irish. We feel the menu offered is a normal breakfast menu as people do request. We do have a cafe in our courtyard also should you have decided to sample something different they do a range of different dishes on their Brunch menu. I do hope you get a chance to visit the castle again as we would be delighted to have the opportunity to welcome you back.

We chose to stay at Clontarf based on our itinerary and TripAdvisor reviews. While the castle hotel is definitely more updated and renovated than perhaps other castle hotels might be, it still has beautiful decor. I absolutely loved the way the foyer and rooms were decorated. The royal purple color was gorgeous! Our rooms were very comfortable. The only downside was the room my husband and I stayed in had a view to nothing through the window. However, the rooms were very clean and the air-conditioning was very nice to have during the warm summer month of August. The absolute highlight of our time at Clontarf Castle hotel was our Fusion Tea! It was so elegant having a tea at a castle. Our servers, Karelyn and Emma were very knowledge about the different tea selections. We were invited to smell each variety and learned about what made up the teas. We had two courses - a savory course with delicious and fancy finger sandwiches, shooters, and other tasty mini food. The second course was my favorite, which was the dessert course filled with scrumptious and beautifully plated cakes, tarts, scones, etc. We were able to choose different tea for each course. It was so filling and so much fun. Karelyn and Emma went out of their way to talk with us and make us feel like royalty. I would highly recommend making reservations for the Fusion Tea! We also had breakfast at Clontarf. The breakfast buffet was very nice with lots of selection.

We also had a delicious dinner at the restaurant. You can also book a massage where they come to your room and then you hop into the spa bath to finish off. It was all the little touches that I loved like the candles on the table.

3285047,Hotel,3,Aman304,Teresa C,"So-So ---SEP--- This property was so-so and not up to Hampton or Hilton standard. There was this strange smell in the kings room, I think the small shed which they have next to King bed rooms facing IHOPS is the reason for that smell as water keeps accumulating over there after rain. Also before using the iron in the room check it out completely because the one I had in my room worked fine for a while and then within seconds leaked some rusted water spoiling my shirt, which I was suppose to wear for my meeting. I believe cleaning carpet, bed and rooms is what everybody does but taking care of small things like cleaning the iron before leaving it in the room for new guest to use is one of the things most of the hotels miss. The lobby was the smallest and usually people have to wait for others to stand for morning breakfast. Breakfast served lacked change and it was almost same stuff everyday, I am not sure why HAMPTON's all over US do not follow same standards. Also as they have the indoor pool which is very near to the lobby, people generally used walk in straight out of pool to the breakfast area as they the property have no signs asking them not to roam around in swimwear etc. The rooms were big and best thing is this property being opposite to Quail springs mall so that you can spend your day shopping or browsing. I have been to HAMPTON LA/ MICHIGAN and couple of others but I did not liked this compared to them.",Thank you for taking the time share your thoughts.

I thought a stay at The Lodge at Garden of the Gods Club would be a good break before we move into an RV park to start our house hunting. BIG MISTAKE! We've enjoyed it here so very much we don't want to leave. It's hard to say what's best. The personnel, the ambiance, the food, the spa, the year-round outdoor pool (the list could go on) all while looking out at the Garden of the Gods with Pikes Peak as the backdrop... One of the most magnificent views you will ever see. There aren't any negatives - all positives - and I can wholeheartedly recommend this place.","We truly appreciate that you chose our Lodge for your break from RVing, and we're thrilled that your stay exceeded your expectations.

On map didnt realise hotel so far from airport, but actually located to the east? of airport, however the hotel free shuttle bus negated any problems getting to the hotel - especially at 10:30pm. The hotel receptionist was friendly and due to my IHG hotels Loyalty card i was a given a room upgrade to a suite, which included a late check-out next day. The suite was clean and very roomy/ comfortable, tho the in-room aircon unit seemed a little noisy until got used to it. The en-suite bathroom seemed clean, the only problem encountered being the shower water controller was stiff and only ran HOT or Cold. As always, the free wifi enabled me to catch-up on the days email etc. Even tho suite at front of hotel, hotel situated far enough back off main hway not to hear traffic noise, and slept soundly on a comfortable King bed. Next morning Just made the ample free buffet breakfast in the cosy dining room overlooking the pool and river, before returning to room till noon checkout (actual late check-out poss til 2pm). Left a room maintainence (shower tap) card with reception on departure, which was acknowledged by email a couple of days later. The only possible negative for this hotel is its location away from the city which would make it hard to get around if staying a few days without a car.",Thank you for your comments regarding your stay at our hotel.

In the morning the balcony was great for waking up with coffee and in the evening you can stand at the rail and people-watch below. The hotel seems to cover all of the details from the coffee in the morning (even on each floor), chocolates, wine/cheese, champagne to the cookies and milk in the evening. This was the first hotel I stayed where there was a pillow concierge. As a cigar smoker, I was very happy that the private and public balconies had an ashtray. I plan to return this fall. Two side notes; 1.) the package I purchased included a carriage ride. The carriage does not come up to the valet area but stays in the loading zone ‚Äì look to the left of the valet entrance, and 2.) the valet entrance is not at 166 Church Street ‚Äì if you have a GPS , put in 74 Linguard St. .","Dear Firegeek, Room 320 is one of my favorite too!

3288835,Hotel,5,NVmom44,G M,"Modern and clean - but maybe no microwave! ---SEP--- We were pleasantly surprised by the modern, airport/cruiseship-like design of this hotel. Walking into the lobby and breakfast area feels like entering a funky airport lounge. Very open, modern and bright design - love it! The double queen room was spacious and comfortable. Also liked the decor in the room. Nice stone counters and desktops, wood accents and pretty wallpaper all pulled together with a fun colour scheme. Everything feels and looks very new in this hotel as does the surrounding retail complexes. Bathroom is bright and spotless. I also appreciate that the counter was large enough to allow room to store toiletries for four, as well as put clothing on when changing. Also a big plus was the four hooks for towels behind the door! This is always one of my biggest gripes about hotel bathrooms - not enough places to hang more than two towels to dry. We try to reuse our towels for at least a couple of days, and without enough places to dry them, that's not always possible. One small complaint is that queen double rooms do not come with microwaves (I was told only King suites have microwaves). To me, this is very odd. I've stayed in many hotels, from 2 to 4 stars, and it was shocking to me that there was no microwave. There was certainly room for one, so I'm puzzled by this decision. Last comment - the hotel doesn't show any photos of their pool, but they do have one, and it even has an indoor/outdoor waterslide! Such a great feature, especially for families with kids. My 6 and 9 YO boys had a blast on the waterslide and splashing around in the pool. Overall, really enjoyed our stay here. Loved the convenience of good restaurants right across the street, and Superstore behind for gas and snacks. A good choice for anyone!","Dear Chrissy D. It sounds like you truly had a blast!

From the balcony, you look directly into the crowns of the trees just beside your balcony. In the evenings you'll fall asleep to a concert of frog calls and the crackle of a fire (if the wood provided isn't damp - my only quip). With dawn, a symphony of birdsong slowly rouses you from your slumber. What better time than early in the morning to go for a walk to Kondalila Falls, which are accessible on foot direct from the treehouses. Just up the road is a quirky little cafe that serves amazing brekky with beautiful views. This is a great place to get away and unwind. It's not cheap but definitely worth the price. I'll definitely return.","Good Morning David B. Many thanks for your review. We always value feedback from our guests! Wow, you're good with words!

3299750,Hotel,2,Grantman66,Moana S,"Taken! ---SEP--- My wife and recently flew to Oahu to celebrate a friends 50th. Our friends live on the Island and after four days with them I surprised my wife with a night in Honolulu. Having visited the Moana Surfrider in the past I knew it was the only hotel that could support a great afternoon and evening in the chaos they call Waikiki. While the lobby bar and staff were what I've come to expect at a Westin the Suite I had reserved was NOT. When we arrived to our suite I was surprised to see how dated and beat up the furniture was. There was no mini bar, no way to plug in an I-device for listening to music and the only music available was pay per listen on the TV. I could swallow all that for the price tag but what I wasn't able to swallow was the cleanliness of this room. The couch had stains all over it as did the lampshades. It was disgusting. On top of that the shower leaked out onto the bedroom carpet. I immediately alerted staff and while I didn't want to cause a big commotion I thought they could clean it up a bit while we were out to dinner. As it happens the house cleaning showed up at 9:40pm to clean the room, my wife was already asleep. Continued emails to the hotel manager, Mr. Anderson, that have so far gone unanswered and I waited to post on Trip Advisor to let them try and reconcile or at least address the issues. Nothing. There is no question that the hotel is the grand dame of arguably the tackiest beach scene in the Western Hemisphere. That said, I think the operators have taken that a little too seriously in their choice d√©cor an lack of cleanliness. I will not stay at this hotel again and will look very hard at any future stays with Westin.","Aloha, Mahalo for your review and for staying at the Moana Surfrider, A Westin Resort & Spa.

I highly recommend the one that goes all the way around the resort and takes approx 20 minutes but we were all able to do it easily. There is also a kids mountain bike training area which my kids loved. There are trampolines, tennis courts, archery, boating etc - all at no cost. Breakfast buffet at Cuisine is predictable but good. The food is constantly refilled and there are a number of coffee machines around. We had lunch at the Alpine Larder and service was incredibly slow (on both days) and the pizzas aren't that big.

We got a family room which was one of the best we have been in as it had 4 real beds, enough for everyone to sleep comfortably. It was on the ground floor and away from any noise so ideal for us. We ate in the quench bar and the food was good without being spectacular. You could see issues with service on other tables with food being late etc. but we found the service good. Under 12s eat free if you stay overnight which was an unexpected surprise and had never come across that before. Saved us ‚Ç¨40 so a nice extra to get. All in all I would recommend this hotel and we would be happy to stay again.Staff were friendly and welcoming. On arrival our room wasn't ready so they gave us complimentary drinks while we waited.

Worse this time. Trevor Bain wants you to think that he is the Mgr on duty; but he is not; he is at home. I tried calling about 7PM to confirm that I was coming but after literally a dozen tries going to a recording after the second ring, I gave up. Got here about 8 and the front desk was mobbed. Which is why they weren't answering the phone. Only one lady behind the desk, Gabriella. More about her later. Guy comes down and has not had his room serviced and there were no towels. My reservation thru the Baymont website that was guaranteed on my credit card because I made it too late to cancel is on record but it is not run on my cc and it is cancellable and they are out of King rooms as was my reservation. The only good thing is that the rate that they are offering is less than the reserve online. Get to the room and the e-key does not open the room. Go back down and get new card plus an extra and this time one of the keys opens the room. Go down to business center to print boarding pass and their printer doesn't work but they will print as the front desk. But their connection and computers are running dog slow. Back to Gabriella. This girl was young but she knew her stuff. She was moving at a pace that you never see from an employee - determined. She operated with purpose and knew every trick to keep things moving. While folks were signing in she darted to the back and got the guy his towels without missing a beat. This girl deserves the Manager's salary and job. I was reminded of the Sergeant Major in Black hawk down that was leading his convoy in to pickup the Marines from the downed chopper, bullets, rockets and grenades flying everywhere but he didn't dodge, duck, show concern, change course or nothing but just kept everybody moving forward. That was this girl. Completely unflustered and still courteous. Baymont, take a friggin hint. Do your job. That being hotel management.

The bed was very comfortable and the mini bar well stocked. The bathroom was size able with a long bath which was unexpected. The hotel is a short walk from the views of Echo Point and the many walks around the 3 sisters. The hotel is set in beautiful gardens and the ""Hatted"" restaurant DARLEY'S is within the grounds. We ate at DARLEY'S and it was up with the best meals I have eaten. The service and quality of the surroundings makes it very enjoyable. I indulged in spa treatments - the spa is beautiful and the staff helpful and professional - a lovely way to end the day after a bush walk.

3197339,Hotel,5,Frances P,Martin P,"Absolutely stunning! ---SEP--- We have only just left this beautiful Chateau after spending two glorious nights there. To reiterate previous reviews, the position and views are absolutely stunning. My husband booked through Secret Escapes but spoke directly to the receptionist. We were looking to stay for two nights and at that time they only had a very small room available for the dates we wanted. She suggested we opt for The Stables which does not form part of the main Chateau but offers an open plan living dining area, kitchen, shower room and double bedroom. We were unable to see this particular room on the website but took her recommendation. When arrived much earlier than the 3 pm check in and were more than happy to wait for our room, we were shown to one of the lounges which had spectacular views and were offered tea and coffee. When we were shown the accommodation we were devastated! Whilst the chateau was full of charm and elegant grandeur, The Stables was bland, smelt damp and lacked any form of character! I could have cried! My husband chatted to Rosie, one of the lovely receptionists who found the most beautiful room for us. As mentioned in previous reviews our shower was in a turret - I should say showers as there were 3! I am not sure why but it looked spectacular and the showers were certainly efficient! Again we had magnificent views. Like one of the previous reviews, we too are fortunate enough to stay quite regularly in 5 star hotels but unlike that previous review, we love to see the individuality and eccentricities of places, and people. We can look past minor issues and concentrate on the overall experience. The overall experience? Wonderful. Every member of staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The 'dining experience' was just that. The experience was not just in the food, which we thoroughly enjoyed, but the meeting with everyone for canap√©s and wine, before being escorted down into the grand dining room. We are used to the type of menu on offer which we prefer, but if you are looking for huge, overfilling, heavy food, this is not for you. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would hope to return.","Dear FrancesP, Thank you for writing such a lovely review of your stay at the Chateau, and for especially mentioning the friendliness of the team and the dining experience.

The check-in staff was efficient, but not feiendly. The room was as per photographs, but I found that the compendium was hidden away in a desk drawer, the phone's speed dial (for room service etc) was not programmed. The tv's Ethernet cable was loose and reception kept dropping out. The Juliet balcony door scraped against the curtain railing when you tried to open it, the front door did not open with the swipe card on a couple of occasions and the walls are paper thin where you can hear everything happening outside!! The tv in the spa bath was at a ridiculous height and tiny. The service of the room service and engineering staff were fantastic!! They were so quick to help with everything and absolutely fabulous to deal with! I cannot praise these guys enough. Unfortunately for some reason the late checkout that had been guaranteed through my booking type was not advised to the front desk staff and this resulted in an interrupted sleep in.

They would alternate between hot and cold water every minute or so, mostly cold. The Manager Lynn was very friendly. There was traffic noise but it was quiet between 11 to 6 am. Tent sites are hard packed gravel so take a hammer to pound in tent stakes.","Hi Marina, I gather that you are the person that complained about the showers to the Campground Host. They in turn investigated the problem and found that there was a problem with the propane heating unit and called me. The Host closed the showers. The problem was found to be a partial blockage of the water tube. The system was flushed , tested and back in service within 45 min. there has been no reported problem since. If readers look back at earlier reviews they will find the performance and cleanliness of our showers are above standard. I hope this meets your standard of expectation of service. If you had inquired further before writing your review we would have been happy to explain. Regarding the topgraphy of our island if you investigate the geology of our area you will find that Salt Spring Island is the result of volcanic upheaval and similar to other such Islands it considered part of it's natural beauty. Our Campground is blended into this topography.

3282359,Hotel,5,Jaw0205,David1007,"Thank you it was a pleasure ---SEP--- The trip was for my partners 40th, she hates surprises so decided to invite friends to stay and enjoy dinner at the Connaught. We were well looked after from start to finish and enjoyed a fantastic weekend! We were warmly greeted at reception and whilst checking in my partner was wished Happy Birthday (simple touch, well received) we had decided to spend a little extra and were booked into the Orchid Suite. Room was lovely, spacious, with two seating areas and a fantastic bathroom with roll top bath and double shower. Room was spotless and the bed was very comfy!! We had booked dinner for 35 guests and were shown to our private dinner room, which again was stunning, The tables were imaculate, dressed in white with a blue color scheme and everything we could possibly need was on hand. We and our guests started to arrive at around 1pm and I think its safe to say took over the bar area, we enjoyed a lovely lunch and moved chairs and tables to accomodate the expanding guests. The staff were fantastic, nothing was too much trouble. A number of us enjoyed lunch and smiles all round. Most of us relaxing in the bar area till 5pm. Dinner started at 7:30pm and once and the staff were fantastic, all three course were delivered in efficient, yet attentive manner, once again nothing was too much trouble!! My partner was served first for every course (something myself i did not noticed) but another small touch that went a long way. I enjoyed Lamb for the main and would happily book again. We headed off into the night, I understand those that left the highlights of the town, were then relaxing in the bar till 2-3am (unsure of the time) but were once again well looked after. Breakfast the next morning was enjoyed in the bar area, with the staff members on duty remember the guests from our party and guiding them through to join us. Breakfast had a lovely choice of all the standard options and was once again all fantastic. I did have a little telling off from the food manager (I presume) as I went to help myself but was told 'No No No, you look, we serve' all said with a smile (I hope). My breakfast started at 9am but I didn't leave till gone 10:30 as more friends joined us, during this whole time tea and coffee was readily available and again nothing!! yes nothing was too much trouble.. We then checked out and headed in to Bournemouth, we were allowed to leave our car, thank you for that. On returning decided to have one more drink in the bar before heading home. We choose the hotel as at the time it was rated as number one in Bournemouth, I am not sure if this is still the case. But the hotel has done my partner and I proud this weekend and all of our friend were positive about their stay. Not sure what else I can add, highly suggest a visit and would book again without question. The only thing I should add, I found the walls a little thin in the bed room, could hear the people in the next room chatting and laughing, but as I had enjoyed a few cocktails was not really worried. Thanks again!!","What a fabulous review Jaw - we were all so pleased to read that your plans and celebrations were such a success, you must have earned a lot of brownie points!!

3166815,Hotel,3,fitzer12,Generalmanagerpark,"Ryanair-style resort ---SEP--- This hotel is about 18 months beyond the point of needing minor renovation. Carpets on the stairs are threadbare and overworn. Very disappointed with the room, it was pretty small and the carpets were threadbare in spots and paint peeling off the walls. The bathroom door had warped due to steam and as a result it could not shut. No bathrobes in the room, they were to be hired as extra!! We stayed in Parknasilla on the first night of 4. It claimed to be 4* and pretends to be 5* however, we stayed in a 3 star three days later and they supplied bathrobes!!! Small touches make the difference!! The staff were very helpful but did leave a little short on the efficiency stakes. The location is absolutely breathtaking but realistically I would not be going back. This hotel is in financial difficulty and it is pretty easy to see that a bean counter is running the show, not a hotelier. I would compare it to a ryanair-style establishment, for a finish I was surprised they were not charging us for the use of the cutlery!!","Dear Guest, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your opinion of your recent stay with us at the Parknasilla Resort & Spa on Trip advisor. I was of course disappointed to read that you were not entirely satisfied with your stay and would like to address the points you have mentioned. While some of the hotel has been refurbished recently we are continually trying to improve our product where possible. The hotel is graded as a four star hotel and resort, and this how we market it. We provide complimentary bathrobes for guests who have booked our Spa treatments or one of our many packages which include overnight stays in our executive bedrooms and suites. I can assure you that the team and I are very proud of the hotel and the level of service we provide in Parknasilla as can be seen in the previous reviews, however in the current climate the financial control aspect plays a vital role in a business‚Äôs survival. This also allows us to offer good rates and also different packages that will include all the extras.

I can be contacted via email on amansworth@parknasillahotel.ie or else please feel free to speak me on 064 667 5600. Once again thank you for taking the time to share your opinion on the Parknasilla Resort and Spa, we value all feedback here at the hotel.

Th hotel was not as close to shopping and pubs as the other locations we stayed in Ireland. The streets and different areas were not as clean as others in Ireland. I would recommend you not venture out alone at night. The wait staff at the hotel were fine but not notable. We were only there one night so my opinion might not be what others would share.

3226813,Hotel,4,Misty M,gmfl760,"Keep in Mind ---SEP--- The thing that really ticked me off about this place is the internet. Not because it went down several times, but each time it did, I had to watch a video to ""EARN my free wifi.""I had to choose either a VW or Audit video to watch for 30 seconds, several times in one day. That, is not free. I don't appreciate it. Call it what it is: Free with forced viewing. Really lame. The elevator: Around the 4th floor and above, it creaks loudly and seems to hit things as it goes up. If you're not a fan of elevators, you won't like it. It's a little disturbing. When you first get in, the DINGS of each elevator level passing are deafening. No joke! Not an exaggeration. The floor I was on smelled like someone needs to steam clean the carpets. Thank goodness the maid covered it up my individual room on the second day with some spray, but it smells like a steamy shower that needs to be cleaned. Not moldy, but it smells like things I'd rather not write here. I did not report this, because the whole floor smells. It's just worse when one enters the room. It's a warm, gross bodily type smell. Other than the odor, room appeared clean. I'm not sure if hot water is for breakfast only, but in the lobby, there is a closed pitcher that says MY Morning Breakfast Water. ?? Does everyone only drink coffee? I was looking for some hot water to go with the tea bags at night. Breakfast is the usual chemical fest, with only 2% and non-fat milk (???). Looks like someone is reading their 1970's nutrition guide. Then, activia, carbs, carbs, colorful carbs, some food I didn't even bother open. The only free breakfast I ever somewhat tolerated was Hyatt Express with their croissant-like egg and spinach like concoctions, to be fair. I stayed at a hotel with whole milk cartons, that was the majority of the takeaways. The door to my room was really really heavy, and trying to get luggage in and holding the door open was quite a feat. At least I didn't hear constant door slams. All in all, I would stay here again because hotels are on some kick about paying more when one books closer to the date, and saving when one books in the distance. I refuse to book like an airline. This one of the few with a decent rating and a decent value. Also, the staff is nice and if they'd just make some very minor improvements, it could be really good.","Thank you so much for your feedback in regards to your stay. Its help us here at the hotel so much improve on our customer satsifaction. I have contacted our internet provider in regards to the video to login I agree it can be frustrating and I hope to rectify it immediately for our guests. Our carpets are being professionaly cleaned this week, the 5th floor was completed about 2 weeks ago. Due to the higher occupancy we were unable to get more accomplished, however they are scheduled to be back on Monday and Tuesday to finish the public areas. I truly do apologize about the odor and I hope you see an improvement on your next stay. Hot water is available 24 hours it is a push top not like the other ones where there is a lever. My staff and I are always available to make sure you have everything you need and I will make sure to have them be more observant in that area.

3186300,Hotel,2,Jay_M_Gee,SurfBeachHP,Great location ......... That is all ---SEP--- Seems all attention must go to cabins as caravan sites are not very good. Sites VERY uneven & not maintained. (Lots of excuses in previous reviews but we've stayed in enough parks to know if any effort has gone in to keeping sites in good condition) We were there 4 days & didn't see anyone tending the grounds the whole time. Lawns very long & grounds generally shabby. Old car battery left at base of tree. No one noticed it. Amenities are hosed out rather than mopped so have soaking pools of water almost all the time. All Rubbish bins kept by amenities block rather than dotted around park. A bit inconvenient having to walk your Rubbish over there each time. Great location is the only thing going for it.,"Thank you for your review, do wonder if you are so unhappy why extend your stay also by your own admission in office you admitted the amenities smelt clean due to the strong cleaning products used, we are very disappointed that you were unhappy.

3270301,Hotel,2,Goannago,metropolekatoomba,"Location is good but there are better places to stay ---SEP--- I was quite surprised that the combined information from the reviews did not match the experience. I usually find that I get a pretty accurate gauge from reading about the best and worst aspects of a place. I agree that this place does have ""olde world charm"" but I don't think that this is enough to redeem it. The location is quite good and in very short walking distance from some fabulous little cafe/ restaurants, which is where we ate, so I can't comment about Metropole meals. It's interesting reading multiple comments about train noise, we did hear trains occasionally but this wasn't the noise that bothered us....the whole place is quite noisy. The noise ranged from creaky stairs, heavy resounding footsteps along the hallway, from upstairs, and on the metal stairs outside our windows (which faced the inner courtyard). It sounded like people were moving furniture around upstairs! Conversations were clearly heard from people walking down the hallway and in the courtyard. The big downside of our courtyard-facing room was lack of privacy. People can quite clearly see into the room from the stairways in the courtyard, unless the curtains are closed (which makes the room very dark) or the frosted windows closed, which prevents ventilation (which the room was very much in need of). I suspect it would be very hot to stay in a courtyard-facing room if the days were hot - we had a cool weekend for our stay. We found the bathroom and the linen to be very clean but the bedroom was pretty dusty, which made my skin very itchy. I was very relieved to shower and checkout in the morning to get out of the room, which allowed my skin to settle down. The reception staff were friendly and professional and did make us feel welcome, it's a shame that the room was disappointing for the reasons mentioned above.","Thank you for your feedback Goannago, we take all feedback on board and are actively committed to ensuring all of our guests have the best possible time while staying with us. I am pleased to advise that we are currently in the process of replacing the carpet and at the same time installing the best quality sound insulation and re-seating the floor boards. Unfortunately, due to the age of the building, the floor boards have seen quite a lot of traffic and therefore are very creaky. All of the above will make a huge difference in terms of building noise for guests and we are very excited for the work to be completed. I am sorry to hear that you had a skin reaction while staying here. Our housekeeping staff service all rooms daily and their stringent processes include thorough dusting and vacuuming, as well as the replacement of linen. The installation of new carpets will also have a happy side effect of significantly reducing the dust in the building. We hope to see you again the next time you visit the Mountains.

3242321,Hotel,4,Nicholas S,CBCRS,"'Effective marketing conceals fundamental flaws' ---SEP--- Cable Beach is just one of those places that had been on my 'must do' list for some years. You've got to admire their marketing as it seems to have some sort of presence across a wide variety of social media and of course many WA Tourism brochures. Looking for a short break to celebrate my wife's birthday, Cable Beach therefore seemed an easy choice, so in late September we flew with Qantas up from Perth to explore this highly rated destination. (this is the 'no frills' version of Qantas - pretty basic I have to say for our national carrier) Our pick-up from the airport was fast and efficient and the driver was most welcoming with an engaging commentary throughout the short journey from the airport to the resort. I guess we were unsure of what to expect, but upon arrival we could not help but make comparisons to places like Bali, which admittedly rather unfair, was always in the back of our minds. Cable Beach is not at all like Bali so don't expect that same wow factor you get in many of the Balinese properties. The reception process was quick and efficient and we were quickly in our room for the 4 night stay we had booked. We were told the rooms had recently been refurbished. Ours was simple, tidy, clean, but unremarkable. Our major disappointment was with the bed which felt like it had been slept in by a bunch of sumo wrestlers for about the past 10 years. It had a mind of its own leaning heavily to the right on one side and to the left on the other. In short, it was well past its 'best before date' and our sense was the mattress was not included in the refurbishment programme. We would recommend that it is! Otherwise the room was fine with good air-con and an excellent shower. The grounds of the hotel are quite spacious, well signed but (and again at the risk of making comparisons to Bali where labour comes much, much cheaper) the grounds themselves looked rather tired and in need of a good tidy up. There are three restaurants on site - they all look very good but we only ate at two of them. The Malaysian restaurant had good food but was spoilt by being served onto cold plates (admittedly a pet hate of mine) but which instantly killed the heat from the food. This is such a basic service error that it was frankly unforgivable and spoilt what was otherwise a well cooked and well presented meal. I suggest if you go here to request hot plates instead of them using the ones that was laid on the table hours earlier. The other fault with the Malaysian restaurant is that it is right alongside a children's playground which even at 8.30 in the evening was being used by small children and families. This is not conducive to a romantic dinner for two! Simply laying the tables so that one had one's back to the play area would have helped! (We moved it ourselves). However, I think they need to rethink that one. Some sort of screening would help. The main beach-front restaurant was much better. The evenings provided a pleasant environment and the food was quite excellent - as were the wait staff. Not cheap, but you would not expect it given the logistics and the distance from anywhere else, but more or less on a par with high-end Perth prices. The steak was some of the best we've ever had anywhere in the world. Breakfast is served in the same area but is a bit more of a 'bun fight' with what seemed like the whole resort arriving to eat at more or less the same time. However, the breakfast was plentiful and in the main, well presented although nothing unusual in the choice. Some operational issues let it down slightly such as the replenishment of serving trays, cold juices etc in situ (with staff pouring supermarket type plastic bottles of orange juice into the dispensers rather than taking them away to replenish in the kitchen area). It just seemed a bit sloppy somehow. But look, you get a good breakfast for $20 per head and that should keep you going for some time. We decided not to hire a car since we only had 4 days and it's a long drive to get anywhere - and the sealed roads go to tracks quite soon after leaving Broome. Be aware that if you hire a normal car you're not allowed to take it off surfaced roads so it all seems a bit pointless. There is a good free shuttle bus service into town or you can pay $4 to catch the town bus which stops directly outside the resort so you don't really need a car unless you want a 4WD and have the time to go off exploring. Avoid taking a taxi unless you want to re-mortgage your house, very expensive! Broome requires you to set your watch back about 50 years - rather quaint really, I sort of expected to see horses tied up outside the bars like in a cowboy movie. However, the pearl shops are excellent with huge choice and variety. Some really wonderful stuff and staff who are very well versed on everything to do with pearls. Meanwhile back at the resort, the adults only pool was really rather nice with its own bar with a good food menu too. My only gripe was that the cushions on the sun loungers need to visit the laundry more often. The staff were once again excellent so full marks to Cable Beach for their staff recruiting and training process. In summary, for young families, Cable Beach probably ticks a lot of the boxes. It's safe, there's enough to do, and the family pool should keep even the most stroppy 7 year old happy. For adults, well I guess its all about personal choice isn't it. For me, I think we would have got more for our money elsewhere but one has to remember the logistical cost of running a resort like this thousands of kilometres from the nearest civilisation. Would we go back? Probably not, but that's simply because we are so spoilt for choice living in WA, but look, why not give it a try. You might be one of the many who just love it and go back year after year. Enjoy!","Dear Nicholas S, Thank you for your comprehensive feedback.

The well layout room and modernised look, it was a real score! The character of the whole Hotel flowed well throughout. We checked in 2 Adults and 2 kids, this Hotel definitely services Families and Corporate Business travellers, there aren't many places that can pull that off. The atmosphere was friendly, staff we passed were were smiley and the whole vibe of the hotel was beautiful. We too made use of the basketball hoop, pool and absolutely LOVED that even the little things like Toothbrush/paste and comb were thought of!!! For the price we scored (thank you WOTIF) we were highly impressed and without a doubt this will remain to be our first preference given we will be regular visitors to New Plymouth with husband working at the Taranaki hospital over the next 6-12 months, this is perfect for our family! With the Buffet Restaurant, pool and Basketball available why would you want to go anywhere else. Well done to the Hosts Peter and Rosemary Tennent, you must be proud of this Paradise! Its been a long time since I've been wowed in any of my Reviews, this is certainly a WOW moment, especially for the fantastic cheap price we found on WOTIF :-)","Thanks for the feedback - yes, we are very proud of our team (and Taranaki).

3224869,Hotel,5,Ann B,FBS1888,"What can you say about this amazing castle in the mountains? ---SEP--- The best part about this resort is just seeing this resort. I can think of no other resort where the outside of it is so captivating. We specifically drove to an overlook so we could get another view of the hotel. Then the best thing about the hotel is the view. Amazing views. We stayed in the Stanley Thompson Wing. Our room did not have a view. I was disappointed in that, but I have to say that the room itself made up for the lack of view. Plenty of space, gorgeous and spacious bathroom. The seating area was comfortable. We had a fireplace...only for looks...it was not a working fireplace. The large screen television was an unexpected plus for viewing the Super Bowl. The third best thing about the resort would have to be the service. Perhaps Canadians are known for their service (I have been overly impressed everywhere I have gone), but this resort must pride themselves on their outstanding service. Everyone seemed determined to be helpful. So many smiles! I will remember this the most. Great service. Finally, the interior is worth a visit all on its own. It is a castle. There is a rich history at this resort. Fun, fun place. I would imagine the summer months are even better!","Thank you for visiting from Indiana and for taking the time to share your positive experience, especially the warm and engaging service you enjoyed.

The buffet breakfast in the beautiful old dining room , which was included in the tariff, was very good with a reasonable array of fruits, cereals etc available.

3180131,Hotel,3,Lou M,GuyHilton-GM,"Not a bad hotel - but could do with a facelift ---SEP--- I booked the King Deluxe Plus rooms for our stay. (Don't be fooled by a so called 'flash sale'. The price of this room - and all their others - increased during that period and went down again afterwards!) Really huge room with lots of space and a 6 foot wide bed which was awesome and very comfortable. Big wide screen TV and a mini bar fridge (empty though). Teas and coffee but no hot chocolate in the room. Small shortbread biscuits. Floor to celing black out curtains - always a plus! The bathroom was average. I had thought the bathroom would be a bit larger and nicer in tune with the room. Also the toilet needed flushing when we arrived - I assume the yellow/grey smelly stuff had seeped back up the pipe. Perhaps the room had not been used in a while? Also quite dusty in places. The toiletries were fine if a bit small, but empty bottles were replaced so that was good. The windows were filthy dirty and we could barely see through them - although all to see was mounds of bird poo. They really need to get a window cleaner. The lights were a bit odd. I couldn't get the desk light to work without the hall light being on too, which is a pain when there is someone else still trying to sleep. Breakfast was brilliant as it always is in a Hilton so no surprises there. Everything you could want and a chef cooking things to order too. Bar prices are absolutely extortionate - don't even bother. ¬£9 for a cocktail? Seriously? We tried out the swimming pool/spa. The changing rooms were all wet with bits all over the floor. Not terribly pleasant. The Hot Tub had loads of foam on it (this is basically body oils and general waste from peoples bodies where the spa hasn't been maintained properly) so we gave that a miss! The swimming pool was ok but a bit stingy on the eyes (again this is where there is not enough Free Chlorine in the water and too much Combined (used up) Chlorine, which is what causes problems and irritation. (Somewhat ironic as we were attending the annual pool and spa show that this hotel has hosted for the last 17 years - clearly they haven't learnt anything. My colleagues said it was the same last year too!) Overall it's not a bad place to stay but it is looking tired in places and could do with a bit of work.","Dear Lou M, Thank you for taking the time to write your comments following your recent stay with us and I am sorry to read of your disappointments about the hotel.

We were checked in by lovely, helpful and pleasant staff. The reception and foyer area is beautiful and spacious. We loved to sit and watch the world go by here, with a coffee. Our room was good - yes, we have had more spacious family rooms in other hotels, but it was perfectly adequate. Two wee issues were finding a bottle of water at the side of the bed from previous guests and also the fridge didn't work. However, the room was kept clean and housekeeping were kind to provide us couple more cups and milk one evening. (We were left one packet of shortbread but between 5 of us, we then requested more) The hotels kids club is great! Kids can eat their dinner with all the other kids at 5pm, however our 2 youngest kids weren't keen as the kids were all only aged 4-7 thereabouts. However, we do realize the average age can change. A wee tip would be to maybe have a separate group for kids from aged 10/11 to 15? Snooker competitions, water volleyball etc etc.. I realize may be difficult to coordinate having two different groups, but would be good for Halloween. Hint hint !! The food in setanta restaurant was top notch! Absolutely delicious. We ate also in Kells bar - also delicious. Staff are so helpful and friendly. Pool is a great size - was confused as to why so much sand at bottom of pool, but we got used to it. Ladies shower area was always full of hair- I know this can just be the fault of lazy folk who don't bother to clean up after themselves, and no fault of the staff who do seem to check on changing rooms regularly.

Yes it has a great location, awesome food and a solid drying room but there is so much that could be better - especially for the inflated prices! It felt like the owners are using the nostalgia that this is an old school ski lodge as an excuse to do any significant work on the place. Our room was noisy from the cracks in the walls & the gaps in the windows. Everything in the rooms is old - like 30 years old. I even asked for a hair dryer - fairly run of the mill when you are paying over $500 a night - and the one I was handed was a tiny travel dryer that had definitely seen better days - and it caught on fire when I turned it on.

3318144,Hotel,4,skye_summer,JackieGuiney,"Amazing view, Beautiful accommodation ---SEP--- Had an amazing stay here. We stayed during September 2013, so yes I do know that this review is well overdue :) . What a absolute beautiful stay we had. The staff are wonderful, helpful, efficient and friendly. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment, 2 floors, the rooms were upstairs with the main bedroom having an ensuite and balcony, and the second bedroom although we had requested a double bed when we booked, which had been confirmed with an email unfortunately had 2 single beds instead. Thankfully the person staying in the room wasn't too upset about it, so we didn't mention it to the staff. The kitchen was well equipped. Comfortable lounge the only small complaint it would've be great if they had a DVD player, due to wet weather we were stuck inside for a day and would've liked to of been able to watch a DVD. Not really a complaint just would've been a nice option for bad weather. The best thing about the Copthorne is the view. Wow amazing, beautiful views of the lake and the mountains, we were lucky enough to see the snow on top of the mountains as our last night there it decided to snow.

3177738,Hotel,3,fablifeforever,GALLERYone D,"Friendly staff but hotel needs updating ---SEP--- Stayed here in April 2013 for four nights. The hotel is conveniently situated on the intercoastal waterway on a water taxi stop and is a few blocks from the beach. There is also a large mall next door as well as a grocery and drug store across the street. While the staff was very friendly, the guest rooms are in need of updating. The suite we stayed in was very spacious, however the chairs in the dining area were all peeling and looked shabby and the couch was extremely worn down. The patio had some sad furniture and our patio also had several old cigarette butts scattered throughout. Aside from the space given in the room, I did not feel that it was worth the $169/night rate. Additionally, if you are bringing a car, they charge a mandatory $25/day valet fee (there is no lot available to park your own car...however there were a few vacant other lots right next to the hotel that were chained off). The lobby and patio area were all very nice and the outdoor bar was a nice place to relax. We didn't end up using the pool but feedback from others is that the pool was kept very warm, so that did not leave us with much desire to use the pool. As I said before, the staff was all very friendly. I can't say I would stay here again.","Thank you for your feedback. Guest room renovations are in full swing, with dining chairs already installed, we‚Äôre almost finished with new carpet and the sofa beds are being installed as we speak. I will mention the condition of the balcony to our housekeeping team. Parking is very limited in the area so we offer valet parking at a competitive rate. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the location, our lobby & patio area, and also the pool bar.

Breakfast buffet definitely not worth the money given there are so many great cafes a short walk from the hotel. They could really lift their game. Hard bacon, cold fried foods and Batista coffee extra $5. The room was a disabled room with large bathroom however many disabled person would struggle with the bath.

3325964,Hotel,2,Jim1365,MDemello,Stay away from this hotel ---SEP--- We stayed at this hotel for our 45th wedding anniversary. What a mistake! We had an ocean front roomand the view and room were great but thats where it ends. The elevators are a nightmare. They are SLOW and in the mornings during the breakfast don't even work at all. Considering we were on the 17th floor this was not fun. Walking up 17 floors is not my idea of a good time. The noise from the next room started at about 1 am every morning and went until at least 4 am every day we were there. I complained twice and at checkout and all I got was let it know if it happens again. This is also a non-smoking hotel and they were doing that also. We slept with our patio door open to get the oocean breezes but had to close the door because of the smell. Also complained about that and I was told that housekkeping would check for signs of smoking but it happened again the next night. I paid close to $200 a night for this room and was there for 6 nights and 5 of the nights thhis went on every night with no action on the hotels part to correct the problem. Definitely don't stay here! I also returned their customer satisfaction email and got a rely from them saying they would forward to that hotel and that they hoped to see us again. That won't be happening@,"Aloha and thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel.

3255173,Hotel,1,LBarrett-Scott,Macdonald Bath ... M,"D for Disgraceful.. Dirty.. Disappointing ---SEP--- We were looking forward to a few days exploring the delights of Bath and had been recommended The MacDoanlad Bath Spa Hotel by some friends. They had spoken so highly of it, so when we arrived I was wondering if there was another Bath Spa Hotel. There were initial signs that this would not be a great stay, when we rang to reserve a room. No information on the restaurant, spa packages just wanted to take our reservation (certainly not 5 star) On arrival the same again ""you have reserved a classic room can I have your credit card for payment?"" No info on the hotel facilities, dining times. The only saving grace was the Head Concierge who took our bags and showed us up to the room. He asked us had we been to Bath before and then gave us some great tips on where to go and what to see. My expectations on our room were high as our friends and the website had portrayed delightfully presented rooms. Were we blown away ""Not at all"" Shabby. Dirty.. Mould growing around the sink and shower.. Broken window catches.. Fraying curtains. old moth eared menus...cup and bottle marks on the tables...broken hangers in the wardrobe.... After a good walk round Bath (which is amazing) we thought we would relax in the Spa.. This should be shut down for Health and Hygiene breeches!! Dirty. Cracked tiles.. probably last cleaned in the late sixties...No towels available.. Water dispenser empty.. "" Could we get some drinks by the pool? "" "" No we do not serve drinks for Health and Safety reasons"" came the reply form the receptionist.. Perhaps she should look around the spa... Certainly not a relaxing experience... Our dinner in the restaurant was amazing. It was a shame that there were only a hand full of other guests in the dining room.. and the waiter recommended a wonderful flight of wines to accompany each dish, which worked really well. Breakfast on the other hand was a complete farce. Our cooked breakfast arrived before our coffee and toast.. dry pre-cooked ingredients.. the buffet.. well I have seen better in a travel lodge!! Other guests were being seated and clearly walking out after not getting served. We were due to stay for two nights...But we could not endure any more. "" you have booked two nights with us and we can not refund the second night "" said the receptionist on check-out...Can we speak to the Manager? Who listened and agreed that our stay had not been to the standards they adhere to usually. He was more than happy to refund our one nights accommodation and cancel the second night without charge. We were very willing to pay for dinner and drinks in the bar... So we thought that would be the end to our horrific stay? After getting a receipt of our refund, I was disgusted to see a few days later the charge for the accommodation taken from our bank account...I rang the hotel to speak to the manager... on four occasions he was away from his desk.. messages taken.. finally on a fifth call I was put through to a PA.. We talked and she would investigate... We are still waiting for the call back!! From the outside it looks like a 5 star hotel.. It‚Äôs a shame the service and the product is not. I would advise to spend your money elsewhere.","Dear LBarrett-Scott Thank you for posting your review of your most recent stay with us here at the Macdonald Bath Spa Hotel.

From the welcome to the facilities to the treatments, we were in heaven! The thermal room with steel swimming pool which reflected the ripples on the ceiling as you swam, the plunge pool and jacuzzi pods, the glass sided sauna and steam room was sophisticated, glamourous and beautiful in black and white. We lay on beautiful white sofas to relax around the pool in cocooning warmth. The modern chandelier in the first room with more white sofas was stunning! And that was just one floor. Above us on the next floor was a gym and above that the chill and relax girls changing rooms and treatment rooms. And above that was the reception and lunch area. Beautiful open fires graced each floor with some having warm relaxation beds - which were blissful to lie on. We tried a manicure, pedicure, tailored facials, neck and back massage in private treatment suites. All were fabulous with information and advice carefully provided. The level of professionalism is sky high. I cost us a fortune but we loved it and will go back on a special occasion. Lunch in the spa restaurant was well-prepared and the menu diverse. Honestly the only fault I could find was a lack of facial moisturiser after I had the final shower of the day before I got dressed and left. Did I mention the cristal curtains in the changing rooms. I could go on... it was amazing! After that we had a quick drink in the central lobby bar. Amazing cocktails and beautiful flowers. We were so relaxed that we didn't wake up until midday the next day - sadly back at home...!

3302484,Hotel,2,Neill H,Grand Hotel M,"Grand in location NOT in hotel ---SEP--- Hotel booked almost 3 months ago for New Year. Family of 4 travelled who are used to staying in 4* plus hotels across the UK and Europe. Confirmed via email from staff member we would receive interconnecting rooms in the new refurbished section of the hotel. To our disappointment we were given rooms 800 and 801 which not only smelt of smoke but also showed extensive evidence of wear and tear. Drawers were broken, wardrobes broken and skirting/architraves showed signs of chipping and damage. This WAS NOT what we had booked or expected. On complaining we were told, by a junior member of staff (yet to be approached by the manager) , that the type of interconnecting room we had booked for New Year was unavailable. We decided to give the hotel benefit of the doubt and accepted a room with 2 double beds. In retrospect this room was totally inappropriate for our needs. To add insult to injury the heating system will keep you awake (459) from 05.45 with extensive and unbearable noises. Whilst I appreciate the hotel dates to mid 1800's this is meant to be the new 'refurbished' section of the hotel. I have stayed in other 'character' hotels ie Castle Leslie/Coombe Abbey with no such problems. At no point in our stay were we approached by management to discuss our issues. Front facing staff were very nice but lacked any authority to rectify the situation. In essence and in our honest opinion this hotel lacks the relevant extra touches to merit its 4 stars. ( not even free wifi in communal areas - Gibneys Pub even had free wifi )The hotel itself including the bar area felt very 'soulless'. Due to lack of meeting our needs combined with the early morning heating 'call' we checked out circa 07.30 and made alternative arrangements for New Year so as not to let our boys down. Would not return and would not recommend if looking for a 'true' 4 star plus experience.","Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to write your review. It is disappointing to see that you have not enjoyed your stay with us. We are sorry you felt you did not receive a satisfactory level of response from our management team in response to your concerns. The hotel has over 200 bedrooms, all of which are continually refurbished on rotation. The rooms you were allocated were unfortunately the last of our older style rooms which are this actually this week being fully refurbished to bring the whole hotel up to the same standards. We are now a completely non smoking property and all of the fixtures and fitting on the former smoking floor have been fully replaced. The hotel dates back to 1835 and in the original building, piping can sometimes make some noise in colder weather. New Years eve is such a very busy night at the hotel and it isn't always possible to offer our guests alternative rooms when we are fully occupied.

3297639,Hotel,4,Colette S,QueensOperations,"Brilliant hotel in the bright lights of Brighton ---SEP--- Stayed here for four nights over the Christmas and New Year with a friend. Personally, we both found Queens Hotel to be the perfect location to explore Brighton. One is in the heart of the action with the promenade, beach and Brighton's famous amusement pier right outside your door so we got to ring in the New Year in style on the beach. Can't get much better than that. You are also near all the shops, restaurants, bars and clubs and local attractions. It is only a 10 minute walk to the train station so you don't even have to worry about taxis. The hotel itself is undoubtedly old and a little bit tired in areas but we found this added to the character of the place. Granted, a couple of chairs in the reception area could do with an upgrade but the bedrooms were clean and comfortable with a large bed, plasma tv and ample storage space. There was constant hot water even if the water pressure in the shower was a little weak. The internet broke down on our second-last day. The lady at the reception did give us a cable to allow us access the broadband but this broke down the day after. I don't know if this is a regular occurrence but it wasn't something that overly bothered us. We didn't use the spa so can't comment on it. Likewise, we didn't eat in the bar although I'm not sure if the bar was serving food as it tended to be quiet in the evenings. Breakfast was very good. They have a mixture of hot and cold food. Some yoghurt would have been nice but again, minor complaint. Our biggest complaint (if we were to be picky) would be the arrangements for breakfast. The breakfast room is undoubtedly too small and we had to queue for seats almost every morning. Perhaps an extension is in order. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at this hotel. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable and we would definitely love to return. Keep up the great work :)","Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback and comments on TripAdvisor following your recent visit.

3194288,Hotel,5,GBarrettWaterford,JohnClesham,"Top Class Hotel ---SEP--- This was my second trip to the Westport Plaza with my wife. Five years ago being the first, and I remember being blown away by the place. So arriving I had expectations, big expectations. The Plaza lived up to it in every way. The room was beautiful, the deal we got included two nights B&B and an evening meal in the beautiful Merlot Restaurant, but our room was a suite looking out onto the roof garden. It was spacious, comfortable and had one free movie per day included. The room also had a kitchenette and mini bar. The only negative being the height of the shower head, I'm only 6ft and I had to crouch to get under it. A minor design flaw but the Jacuzzi bath certainly made up for it. We had a lunch in the bar which was tasty but nothing special, some of the servers were in training but you wouldn't know it. We also ate in the Restaurant Merlot as part of the package and again I enjoyed every minute of it. The food was very tasty and piping hot. Breakfast was plentiful and well cooked, but I feel the quality of the ingredients could be improved upon to make it just that bit better, to tip it over the edge so to speak. We also made use of the thermal suites and the Rasul Chamber. To be honest the Chamber was okay, but I wouldn't do it again, the suites are well kept and very enjoyable, including the outdoor rock pool. I would have liked to have the run of the spa explained a bit better to me but its not by any means a deal breaker. All in all it was again a very enjoyable stay in a beautiful part of the country. The hotel is located just a few minutes from everything in Westport including Westport House. I will say this though, as much as I enjoyed the stay the staff although not unfriendly weren't overly friendly. It really felt like they were just doing their job and no more, which is fine but just a little cold. But two members that stood out for their friendliness and welcoming were the young girl, with black hair on reception Monday 23.03.15 and the gentleman who I presumed was the restaurant manager. Neither could have been more friendly and welcoming if they tried. Also the WIFi is excellent. I know I picked some negatives in this review, but as I said overall I really enjoyed my stay again, any criticisms are meant purely to be constructive and I certainly wouldn't put anyone off staying in this lovely hotel.","Dear Guest, Thank you very much for your feedback.

Smooth check in occurred and then we were so surprised by the welcome kit our dog received. So sweet and thoughtful.

This hotel charges a very reasonable $25/night per dog and throws in a kit including a map of local area dog parks, a toy, a couple waste bags and treats! Very thoughtful; thank you. The other aspect we loved with this pet friendly hotel is that all families with pets are to stay on the first floor of the hotel.

3325857,Hotel,1,Shalen S,Edward J,"Well below expectations ---SEP--- Booked Novotel Rotorua for a winter escape in August. We booked on Thursday night. Drove to the hotel. We had asked for a late checkout and a room facing the lake. Upon arrival we were reminder that we are ""Classic Members"" for the Le Club awards so that would be no upgrade. Once inside the room,we noticed the pillows were sruffy and large spots on the carpet. These spots were fresh. We called the guy who checked us in. We told him that we would like to check out. He invited us to talk to the duty manager. The duty manager was unapologetic and had no interest in empathising. She took us to another room on level 3. This room wasn't lake facing but had better pillows. In front of the door there was a large stain on the carpet. We checked in, went for a quick walk to the lake. Decided that the hotel experience had spoilt our holiday. We asked to check out due to the poor state of the rooms. The same duty manager was unapologetic. However, she wasn't willing to confirm that there would be no charges. After a few strong words, she agreed to confirm via email. We checked out and moved into Rydges Rotorua. The experience was much better and for once the hotel cared about their guests. DO NOT go to Novotel. Horrible experience.","Dear shady620, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

This was our first experience with a Micro Hotel, and the rooms were as advertised...small. They have a great bar next to the lobby, with a fireplace, and plenty of window seating.

3258214,Hotel,3,gmcCalifornia,Mario R,"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and Lloyd ---SEP--- My wife and I spent 6 nights at the Hilton Queenstown, New Zealand and really left with mixed feelings about the stay. Last year I had over 150 nights in hotels and have never left a hotel as perplexed as I was when leaving this property. LLOYD: The Cru Wine Bar has a bartender named Lloyd. He is awesome! Rare to find such a professional poised young man. A true asset to this hotel. THE GOOD: This property is a beautiful property for sure. Located right on the lake with generous walking paths it is truly an unique property with a wonderful feeling. The rooms are nicely appointed and are very very comfortable even with fireplaces. The breakfast is OUTSTANDING and we really looked forward to having breakfast every morning which is funny because we are not big breakfast people. THE BAD: The property is located about 30 minutes from town which can be a bit of an issue if you want to freely go to town. A shuttle runs ever half hour or so which is OK. The bad part about this is that the Hilton Queenstown recognizes they have you trapped away from town and make every effort to suck every dollar out of you at every turn. A glass of average wine $16.00, A personal pizza $28.00, a beer $10.00, Chinese food for two with no drinks $60.00, bottled water $6.50, etc. etc. etc. I expect to pay a little more in hotels but these folks take to another level. Although the rooms are really nice housekeeping doe the absolute minimum required with zero extra effort. When we arrived there was a roll-away bed in the room and after calling three times to have it removed I finally went to the front desk to personally ask. There were no chairs on the balcony which also required 4 requests to get them so we could enjoy the view. Not once in a week were the dirty windows or glass balcony walls cleaned. We decided to see if our room was being vacuumed and placed small pieces of paper on the floor in obvious locations where they remained for three days. THE UGLY: After a solid week of being sucked dry of every dollar possible this hotel charges 1.5% if you use a credit card to settle your bill - UNREAL!!! I doubt many people pay in cash to stay a week at a hotel. I would imagine they could easily put 1.5% in the rate and you would never feel it. This really rubbed me the wrong way.... Overall, I would likely not stay here again and opt for another hotel because of the blatant quest for revenue that this hotel strives for.","Dear gmcCalifornia, thank you for your review. Firstly I want to thank you for your kind word about Lloyd. I will make sure that he gets recognised for his customer service. Secondly the pricing in all our hotel facilities are constantly reviewed and reflect the market and the competition in the same category. Your feedback is highly appreciated and I have shared it with the management team to take into consideration. Please accept my sincere apologise for the poor standard of housekeeping. Please rest assured this is not the standard we aim to offer. I have shared your feedback with the Executive Housekeeper to action accordingly. At booking stage all New Zealand Hilton Hotels advise our guest about the credit card supplement charge.

The car parking is very limited and is ¬£15 a day. The entrance to the car park is on Bute Terrace about 10 metres before the traffic light. Buzz the intercom for parking. Reception and cleaning staff are fast and attentive, although the cleaner left a large chunk of broken glass by the bed. Breakfast is a highlight. It's a good breakfast, although there is nowhere to set down your plate as you take the lid of pots. I expected the business suite room to be far bigger than it was. In fact it's the same room as a standard room but with free movies, don't waste your money. The beds are too soft, so you get back ache. The lifts give out too many annoying verbal announcements.

The exterior may not looks appealing that's because they have kept the building facade as well as the exterior unchanged, but the renovated interior of the room is definitely delight you. Almost every things you in the room is new, hence what you get is a clean and fresh room. Tea, chocolate and coffee are standard in almost all hotels in NZ, hence it is a no surprise to me.

3302985,Hotel,1,GRDL,SeaportGM,"Might as Well Be Homeless... ---SEP--- Seeking disappointment? Well, you've come to the right place. Guests contemplating stays here should arrive at the Seaport Hotel without any expectations that things like confirmed reservations will be fulfilled. People, like me, silly enough to reserve a room through the hotel's reservation line, and confirm it with a credit card number, will long for a hotel where such things are actually honored. While some of the staff is amiable, others here seem out to prove that guests are nuisances, and above all that promises are not worth keeping, especially when bedraggled travelers show up armed with a flimsy confirmed reservation. Instead of confirmed reservations, potential guests at the Seaport Hotel should arrive with low expectations, especially for things that one might reasonably expect at other hotels. When these guest (the ones with low expectations) are then cast off like a homeless person, they will not be disappointed after all when they - despite careful planning - have to find shelter - and at the last minute - at some other waterfront SRO.","We appreciate it when a guest brings his/her dissatisfaction to our attention so that we may apologize and make amends for our shortcomings. This guest arrived with a reservation confirmation that he had canceled several hours after making the reservation. He admitted he received the cancellation notice from his travel agent. We were in a difficult situation: the hotel was sold out, along with much of the city. We offered assistance in multiple ways over lengthy discussions yet he refused and demanded a room which we could not provide - it would displace a guest with a confirmed reservation. Unfortunately, although sincere, this guest‚Äôs memory is not supported by the documentation, both his and ours. Despite offers to help and expressions of concern, our offers were rebuffed. This is a very unfortunate circumstance and we regret this guest was unable to be satisfied. Kind regards, James M.

The views from room 2 were amazing and the actual room was the most comfortable we had stayed in for a long time.

It was plenty big enough for us, but like most of the guests staying at the same time we also had as much cereal and toast as we wanted. You couldn't find more friendlier hosts than Emma and Zed.

I am also pleased you found Room 2 to be so comfy and found the atmosphere to be really friendly. We would like to thank you for your comments about the breakfast as we have trialled various sizes of breakfast over the past three years and believe we have found a size which suits most people (Bacon, Sausage, Hash Brown, Mushrooms, Beans, Tomoato and a choice of Egg).

3302835,Hotel,4,Doug S,Kirsten D,"Space, and Solitude?, in Vegas ---SEP--- Being connected to The Venetian makes The Palazzo big even by Vegas standards. But it is also a little less hectic, a little more elegant, and very self-contained. The Venetian/Palazzo property really is a city within Vegas and this can be good and bad. The Good: Every room is a spacious, well-appointed suite. These rooms would be significant upgrades in most other Vegas hotels and, frankly, not even available in many. Bathrooms are huge, beds comfy, noise levels very low, and furnishings top-notch with my favorite feature being a sunken living room with comfortable sectional couch and large TV for chilling out in. You can really escape from ""Vegas"" in your room. The casino and bars are not packed and are similarly appointed. The Venetian/Palazzo restaurant choices are exceptional and the Canyon Ranch Spa/Fitness Center is decadent. Oh, and if you are in town for a conference there is direct access to the Sands Convention Center. The Bad: You may never leave. This is a phenomenon that, as a frequent traveler, I hate. Vegas, to me, is a place to get out in and explore the different nooks and crannies that make it unique. There are great bars, restaurants, shows, and clubs in every hotel ‚Ä¶ I like to get around and experience the variety. One really can't criticize much about this property- truly. But I like to wander and Palazzo keeps me too close.","Dear Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience.

The room (we got a free upgrade to an ocean view) was spotless, view was amazing, couldn't have asked for more. The food from the hotel was delicious, tried a few different things, the burger was beautiful, but the eggs royal were a personal favourite at breakfast, and since continental breakfast came with any of the cooked food I personally couldn't manage all the food when I ordered the full fry up anyway. And even though it is expensive, it really is worth it for everything we tried. The pool and spa area are gorgeous. And the relaxation room really was a joy to be in while waiting for the girlfriend to have a facial and massage, which I'm told was also fantastic. The staff in the hotel couldn't have been more helpful, it really did seem like nothing was too much trouble for them. If I had to be VERY picky, I did feel the drinks were a bit on the expensive side, ¬£4 a pint seems silly. But saying that I would, and in fact will be, staying here again as soon as I can.

We have very important clients who have flown in to run an assessment centre today. We had scheduled a meeting at 8.00am today before the assessment. I was leading this and I was the one with all the paperwork needed.

I called the hotel to explain and Denis very kindly took receipt of a number of emails and photocopied documents that were needed and delivered them to the room. He also confirmed to me that this had been done, as he could tell I was worried. I arrived 3 hours late and the client wasn‚Äôt really any wiser as everything had gone smoothly.

3216531,Hotel,1,Veronica C,JennG383,"1st visit in 2018 was great, but downhill and disappointing this time around. ---SEP--- This is our second time staying at Hotel Born in Denver, we‚Äôre partial to Kimpton hotels and our first experience here in 2018 was great. My husband and I eloped and stayed here during our trip. We decided to make a return trip one year later and made it a priority to book Born for our stay, however this experience has been disappointing from the first steps in the door. To name a few, here are some of the unsatisfactory experiences or conditions we‚Äôve had in our first hour on property: 1. Rude, confrontational, sarcastic parking security attendant. Watched us park in an unloading area and wheel in our luggage, then followed us inside to the check in desk to abrasively interrupt with ‚ÄúHEY! Is that y‚Äôalls car. You gotta move it now‚Äù We‚Äôre not stupid, we know parking is offsite and we‚Äôve stayed here before.) 2. Check-in host was unhelpful when asked how and where to park, or even for any nearby parking garage recommendations. His response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs hard for me to find a spot when I come to work, so...good luck.‚Äù 3. We checked into our room after a long day of travel. Walked in and for some reason the bedside table drawer was pulled all the way out and left open. Strange, but nothing I would normally care about. What bothers me is when there is long hair still in the bathroom floor. Worst of all, there is dried blood and/or body fluids on the tile around the base of the toilet. It‚Äôs not hard to miss, it was first thing I saw when I opened the door. So now I‚Äôve put my shoes back on to walk around the room, trying to be wary of what‚Äôs been cleaned and what hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure if the cleaning wasn‚Äôt thorough or if we were just placed in a room that had not yet been attended too. We‚Äôve yet to get a phone pickup on the front desk or guest service line. Moral of the story: don‚Äôt travel in on an evening flight and arriving for check in at 10pm, service is subpar and we‚Äôre still awake and exhausted at 2AM trying to just have a clean room to rest in.","Thank you for your review of your stay with us while traveling to Denver.

3163334,Hotel,4,B N,TeamMarriott,"Views for days ---SEP--- This is my first time staying here even though we‚Äôve been to the island more times than I can count. The shuttle we took dropped us off in the shuttle area and it was a walk to the lobby. Granted not a long walk but after a flight and carrying bags it feels like a long haul (though not). Check in was easy. Our room was on the 14th floor with an amazing view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond head. We paid for an ocean front room and I‚Äôm still not 100% sure the difference in general of paying for ocean view versus ocean front. We had told our family to book at the same hotel and we had 6 rooms. One of the party got upgraded to an ocean front and was directly over the infinity pool so had a true ocean front. That is what I thought we would get. However, I adored my view and it was actually the view I wanted. The hotel is going through some construction just FYI. The people that got upgraded to that ocean front room had issues though. Since they were on one of the floors that was being renovated, they could only take one side of the bays of elevator to get to their floor. This is an issue since the elevators are random and could come at any time, also there are a lot of guests so its dependent on a lot of factors. The members in that room also changed rooms since they were woken up by construction noise and there was sawdust you could smell and feel in the air. My room on the other hand didn‚Äôt have that issue. The room is a bit dated but I know that the updated rooms (the one that was ocean front) were quite modern. Our TV was a big issue. It worked the first day fine but then the next few days it wasn‚Äôt working and just had an antenna signal. We called down the first day and they said they knew about it and was working on it. Now I know people will say you‚Äôre in Hawaii you dont need one or whatever, but when you are in you‚Äôre room and getting ready or what not or even in bed, its nice to have a TV. On the second and third day we finally called down again and complained. They at least credited the resort fee. But to be honest the TV in general was still glitchy (good luck if you have kids). The infinity pool was beautiful and not as crowded as I had expected my only minor complaint is that the water was too warm but we still spent a lot of time in it. Overall good experience! I really like the location and even the shops within the hotel. My room even though dated (for now) had my ideal view of any hotel on the strip!","Aloha B N, Thank you for your great comments and review of your visit with us.

After 5 minutes a man arrived and continued to serve her. The check in itself was a normal check in. My room was on the ground floor and through 2 fire doors. My room had no air conditioning but i did have a fan and the window was left open which is not a good choice on the ground floor. the room itself was comfortable and clean with 2 twin beds. I was woken by the noise of a dog barking in one of the nearby rooms. After a period of time I rang reception to ask if the hotel had any dogs staying, I was told that 'Yes, we are a dog friendly hotel'. They said they would contact the owner. I then heard some noise outside and someone entered the room (after banging all the fire doors)going shhh. Reception rang me back to say that they had spoken to the owner of the dog and they thought it was the music from the bar that a was making the dog bark so the hotel had turned the music down in the bar. Some 10/15 minutes later I heard another dog barking but this didn't last long. I am a frequent traveller and if I had known this was a dog friendly hotel I would not have stayed or at least asked for a room away from the noise.","Hi Sunshinemap Thank you for your review of our Hotel.

Road conditions are poor to fair. In summer, road construction is a fact of life. So when you arrive in Dease Lake, you feel as if you have stumbled upon an oasis. We arrived at the Northway Motor Inn shortly after 7 PM. Our family of 4 adults, 3 children, 2 dogs and two vehicles secured the last 2 rooms. The manager, Dede, asked if we had eaten, as the only place to eat in Dease Lake had closed at 7 PM. We had eaten prior to arrival, so it was not a problem for us. However, Dede does stock some frozen dinners for those who arrive late, and need to eat. Our room was spacious, comfortable and clean. Dede was welcoming, told us about the town, the history of the hotel, and when the cafe across the street would open.

3211649,Hotel,5,Gaz,Jennifer D,"Excellent new hotel in the centre of Cardiff ---SEP--- An excellent addition to Cardiff's portfolio of hotels. I hope the room rates continue to be as reasonable as they were when I stayed, and they don't start to creep up as some of the other Cardiff hotels have done. Excellent staff, very efficient, friendly and welcoming. Rooms are beautifully furnished and very well equipped - really comfortable beds, good bathrooms and showers, and plenty of power outlets (and USB charging ports) everywhere. The only thing that's missing is soap dishes in the bathrooms - the small bars of soap have nowhere to rest, meaning they have to sit on the worktop next to the wash basin. The only downside of this hotel is something that can't be fixed, but should definitely have been thought of at the planning/design stage. There's only one lift, serving 100+ hotel rooms (potentially 200+ guests) and the restaurant on the top floor, including kitchen staff transporting food from basement storage to the kitchen (I shared a lift with a chef and a large box of mushrooms one evening!). This is nowhere near enough, and can result in some long waits for the lift to get up to the higher floors.","Hello Gareth H, Thank you very much for leaving us a great 5* review! I am glad you loved your Welsh themed room experience and hop you will look to stay with us many more times in the future.

First impressions weren't great. Receiptionist at booking wasn't friendly whatsoever - bad day or something and that set the tone. She was very distant. THEN there was Floyd - a porter. He made up for everything. Couldn't have had more personality. Room was satisfactory - nothing more. TV sucked - needed to have someone come in to fix it. Getting rooms cleaned was a big 'production' at times and always someone knocking and checking up on cleaning staff. Gym and pool were alright. We stayed on 5th floor so that was convenient. As well, they checked us in early without making a big issue - that was great, and let us stay 2 hours later - that was great as well. Very accomodating Best secret was restaurant - Steve's across the street - down one block. Awesome in every way. American cooking - relaxed. ..Sad part is - there is nothing going on downtown. Very little shopping to be had. Wednesdays (4 - 8 pm) Saturday mornings 8 - 12) there was a fun market. Enjoyed that. Lots of homeless meandering around so I didn't always feel safe.

This is hands down the best hotel we have stayed at so far. From check-in to check-out we were treated like royalty. The front desk employee was so kind and genuine. When she found out my birthday was the following day, she gave us free hot breakfasts. The suite was beyond our expectations. So big and well appointed. Robes, slippers, free mini bar, etc- Nothing was missed. To my surprise in the room waiting for we was a lovely box of fine chocolates with a heartfelt birthday note. What a lovely gesture! Our suite included access to the club lounge which was outstanding!!! Excellent views of the planes taking off and landing and lots of room to unwind and enjoy complementary hot and cold drinks. Then from 5-7pm it was Happy Hour with out of this world snacks, which were more like mini meals. They also had a nice variety of wines and other convivial beverages. Loved It! The bed was so comfortable, I forgot where I was. It was a treat to put on their thick robes and comfy slippers while getting ready in the morning. The breakfast buffet on Christmas morning was vast and beyond our expectations. We had never seen such a glorious spread like this one before. There was so much choice and everything was delicious.

We had only ever stayed in Novotel once but we were really looking forward to it. Unfortunately we didn't have the best stay. My daughter has food allergies and as I know this can be difficult at meal times I let the reception know before we checked in. Their response was that they didn't have anything to do with it and to tell the restaurant in the morning. I thought this was strange but did as they said. The next morning I told the waiting staff about the food allergies and their responses were even more shocking. Although some members of staff were friendly, (the chef couldn't help us enough and really tried to make our experience a good one)others were simply rude, making us feel that we were a nuisance for having allergies and even refusing to check ingredients until being asked a few times. One particular staff member even muttered fussy under her breath and wewe're advised that some food was safe to eat and only when i asked them to double check did they find out it wasn't. We felt embarrassed, upset and we're made to feel a nuisance for something which we couldn't help and would make our daughter sick if we didn't address. We did inform reception about our issues and we met with the restaurant manager, (who was also lovely) but we feel that the situation really could have been handled better. There should be updated allergy menus available and better communication between reception and kitchen would have solved the issue entirely. They refunded half of our stay, but this really was little compensation for how they made us feel and the stress that we went through. We have never been treated like this before in any other hotel. It is such a shame because certain staff members were a credit to the company ( the chef would have gone out especially and purchased food we could eat had he been told when we arrived...which is obviously amazing) but the hotel really has been let down by the care given to its visitors on this occasion by some members of staff.","Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at the Novotel Cardiff Centre.

Very disappointed as the room was tiny, the king bed was two singles pushed together. Couldn't sleep in the middle of the bed as the gap was very uncomfortable. No mini bar, white stains on the curtains, desk chair and bed cushions. Bathroom was tiny. No place to put shampoo and soap except on the shower floor. The shower was moldy probably because there was no exhaust fan... Even a short shower resulted in complete fogging up of the room. No hair dryer. View was a building wall. Traffic noise kept me awake until 1am and woke me up at 5 am. Ordered room service. Was told it would take 1 hour..it took 2. Didn't get dinner til past 10pm Would not stay here again due to the above mentioned issues. I have stayed at cheaper places in better locations in Melbourne and had much better rooms. Good things: Great staff. Every interaction was fantastic. Best staff I have ever encountered and this goes to the check in and check out staff, the cleaners and the food service people.

Staff are excellent (especially the mini bus driver) and the facilities are second to none. Beautiful food in the downstairs restaurant and breakfast had a great choice. Grounds of the hotel have loads to see and do with great views over the lakes and brilliant walking trails. The only negative was the king bed had two single mattresses pushed together, which a few hotels seem to be doing. This is something I really dislike and the pillows were way too soft and flat, so did not get a good nights sleep here. Apart from that though everything else was fabulous. Will definitely come back for another visit and will strongly recommend to family and friends. Without doubt this is the best hotel in Cavan.","Dear Christy B Thank you for your Trip Advisor Review.

Wade is exceptional and always puts the customer first, when the slide went down on Thursday evening thinking as a parent and his children, not wanting to disappoint any families he called all reservations that had children listed so they could have the option of booking else where. The slide has been repaired but not before disappointing our guests for which we are truly sorry. I work with exceptional people and we truly do care about our guests.

3218552,Hotel,5,Brad B,Carlie D,"Really Good WeeK Long Stay ---SEP--- My wife and I come to Phoenix twice a year to visit my daughter who is living in the area. After reading some of the reviews here, I almost switched back to the Hampton Inn Baltimore we usually stay when in Phoenix, it's right down the street. I'm glad I didn't! This is our new ""go to"" hotel when in Phoenix. Not sure if others reviewed the same place I stayed at. The rooms were very clean, the staff was great, and the food was what is to be expected with an inclusive deal. It was nice to have real dishes and silverware (as opposed to plastic plates and utensils at the Hampton Inn). There was a good variety in the morning, and plenty of room in the shared dining room. Our room was large and clean, a very good value as there was so much space. Other reviewers seem to think this place is out of date, and maybe I'm not up with the latest furnishings but it seemed fine to me. The room consisted of kitchen, dining area, living area, bedroom, bath and an area with a sink between the bath and bedroom. We had a flat screen TV in the bedroom and living area. The kitchen had black appliances (fridge and stove top, no oven) and stainless steel sink mounted on top of the granite counter tops. Maybe it was the way the sink was done that gave others the feeling it was dated. If you want to do some grilling while you are there, there are two gas grills out by the pool that guests can use. Fry's and whole Foods is right across the street. This came in handy as my daughter had a late day at school during our stay, and wanted a steak dinner when she got out.",I am pleased you are able to enjoy all that a Homewood Suites has to offer on your trips to visit your daughter.

3228999,Hotel,5,Kris M,AmoraJamisonGM,"Five stars all round ---SEP--- I'd narrowed my search for a Sydney hotel down to around a dozen, but I chose this one mainly because of the reviews on here. I rely on these heavily when choosing a hotel for the first time (as I tend to stick to the same place when revisiting) so I will review this in my usual style. Booking went well. I was slightly concerned I hadn't been charged, but a simple email explained that charges aren't processed until you arrive, so that put that worry to bed. I decided to get a taxi to the hotel from the airport. I've no doubt other options are available but I always prefer the easiest option after a long flight. It cost $56 which I thought was a little steep, but there again it is a long journey and based upon other taxi journeys I made, that price seems fair and not a taxi driver trying to rip off a tourist at the airport. I would imagine bus or train options would be easy, as Wynyard Station is five minutes from the hotel, but I won't dwell further as I didn't use this. Check in was impressive. Although I had informed them I would be arriving around 10am, I didn't expect the room to be ready. But it was! A nice and unexpected surprise after a long flight. I did have concerns I would get one of the older, and not refurbished rooms, however the gentlemen at reception informed me I had a fully refurbished one. That is something that worries me about this hotel. They seem to make a point of informing you that your room is virtually new, as was commented to me a few times. That makes me think that not many of the rooms in the hotel have been completed. That, combined with the manager on here consistently writing that they are in the middle of an upgrade (which I think sounds like an excuse for the room not being to standard) is a worry but this is not something which affected me. Having said that, I think it would be a valid complaint to say you weren't happy with the quality of the room citing the fact that you are paying the same as someone who has got one of these. However, like I said this did not apply to me. I had a corner room on level 7 (room 17) and it was fantastic! I have stayed in suites which have been smaller than this room. It had four large windows which let in plenty of light but had blinds and curtains to restrict this if and when needed. I'll make it clear now that I choose hotels based upon their location to where I want to be, and also the service. I doubt unless you choose a club room (and thus pay through the nose) you will get a view from your room. Mine looked out onto the road, a small park and a number of tower blocks. That didn't bother me in the slightest, as I go on holiday to see and visit places, not sit in my hotel room looking out of the window, but be aware of this. So, the room itself. Bathroom was a separate room which had both a bath and a really powerful shower with a number of settings. I was slightly put off by the massive plain glass window adjacent to the bath (bearing in mind it faces an office block) although you can drop the blind for a bit of privacy. Personally I would of expected privacy/tinted glass but that's not the end of the world. The bed is huge, comes with a variety of pillows and also has a seating area which was nice. I didn't really use the TV but it is a Smart one with extra content available at a premium. The mini bar was quite impressive. A variety of spirits in one drawer, a fridge with beers/wine and soft drinks and also some snacks. I didn't find the prices of these too bad, around $5 for a lemonade and the spirits were around $12. Restocked daily along with complimentary tea and coffee. The safe felt a bit cheap to me, but it's plenty big enough for a laptop and is fixed in the cabinet so it more than serves the purpose. All the units are self closing which is a nice touch as they don't seem anything spectacular to look at. I do agree with what some people have said that it seems like different parts of the hotel have been renovated at different times. The main thing I noticed was the doors. I'd say its a banker they are originals from when the hotel opened. It doesn't really make any difference but first impressions count and they do look old and worn. I also haven't stayed in any hotel (five star or not) recently which still uses the cards on the door handle for privacy or housekeeping. The doors were also my biggest irritation as the guests loved slamming them in the early hours. I would recommend the hotel look into this if and when they change them, as being constantly woken from 5am would be the only thing that makes me consider whether i do want to return. So that's the room done. I didn't use the business facilities so I will skip that. The pool and spa was what interested me but I was a little bit disappointed. The gym, whilst still having enough enough equipment for what I needed, is quite outdated. Considering the investment the hotel has made in other areas the gym stands out like a sore thumb, and I do hope they replace and update the equipment before I return. The pool itself is really nice and the lighting has a nice effect, especially at night. The jacuzzi and sauna/steam room facilities are also what you would expect. Seating around the pool I found quite strange. There are some sun beds but then also a couple of 'sofa type' things which I think look massively out of place and not something I would expect in a five star hotel. The Amora Spa is possibly the only part of my experience that I thought was typical of a five star hotel. I didn't use it so I can't comment on the service, but I thought the prices were vastly inflated. Maybe it's standard Sydney prices, I'm not sure, but near on $200 for an hour massage was not something I was prepared to pay. Disappointing, as it did seem underused while I was there and I would of used it if these prices were reduced. The bar and other seating areas were nice and modern, again with good prices which were short of what I would expect in a five star hotel. I didn't use the room service option so I will skip this but there seemed to be a good variety available at all hours. There are two restaurants available, opposite each other on the same floor. I'm surprised they don't market their Spanish one more (I walked past it twice on my way to the Gallery not even realising it was open. Normally I avoid hotel restaurants because the prices are high and part of the fun of being on holiday is exploring what options are available in your area. However I used the Gallery on my first night mostly out of convenience and I was hugely impressed. The menu is varied and the prices are incredibly low. They haven't compromised on service, that is true five star, but you don't feel that you are paying for it. Jade was especially nice, as was another lady I unfortunately didn't catch the name of, but considering how many people they must see during the course of a day I found it touching that she could remember serving me a week previously. It was the restaurant area that I also experienced something that I can only describe as bizarre. I was aware that on a Saturday they offered a seafood buffet, which didn't interest me as I'd already eaten tons of the stuff. Not realising the Gallery only offers this, I went there to see something that wouldn't be out of place in Butlins here in the UK. For those who don't know what that is, my view upon entering the restaurant was a Michael Buble/Elton John tribute act performing in front of some heavily intoxicated middle aged woman, who I felt were embarrassing themselves by how they were behaving. I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a top hotel. I chose to divert to the Charr restaurant, which turned out to be a blessing. The food was excellent, yet with very reasonable prices. I did think it was a bit tacky that you walk in to a glassed entrance with cans of olives, salami and other various food and drink items seemingly on display. I don't quite get what they are trying to do there. Overall I thoroughly recommend you visit their restaurants. One of the most enjoyable parts of this hotel was how relaxed it was. I've been in hotels before where I feel I'm being judged just because I'm not wearing a suit. In the Amora I thought nothing of walking through the doors at 7am caked in sweat and wearing some well used running gear. When i visited the Sheraton (which was also one of my options) to see a friend I thought I was going to be challenged by the concierge because of the way they looked at me. Be aware that some of the better named hotels in Sydney (like the Sheraton, along with the Four Seasons and others) really don't look anything special and the rooms are very poor. These will easily command $200 a night more. Disregarding the views you might have from your room, the location could not be better. Exit the hotel and turn left, walking straight for around three minutes and you will arrive at Darling Harbour. Exit and walk dead ahead and in five minutes you will be at Circular Quay. Finally turning right will take you into the shopping district and to the train and bus station. Nothing is more than five minutes away. There's also a shopping mall thirty seconds away which houses a number of places to eat and drink along with a Woolworths on the ground floor. I decided to venture further and walked to Centennial Park. It took under half an hour which included stopping at a coffee shop. If you look at how far it seems the hotel and the park are from each other, with the knowledge of how long it took me to get there, and suddenly this hotel could not be in a better place. Yes you could be right in the harbour or the quay but then everything else is further away. Finally, check out was a breeze and the concierge soon hailed me a taxi from the rank across the road. I was only too happy with my stay and definitely feel like I chose the best hotel in Sydney. If you want five star service without the price then this is the place to come. I look forward to returning in the very near future.","Dear Kris M, Thank you for staying with us and providing your feedback. I appreciate your kind comments regarding the service received and your special mention of Jade. I look forward to your return to Sydney, kindly contact me on Arpad.romandy@sydney.amorahotels.com and I will be able to assist you with your booking and perhaps have an opportunity to run through some of the comments you made in person. One comment I do wish to address, is your comment regarding the renovation and the pricing of the rooms. As we have over 15 different rooms types, charging more for the renovated rooms would have resulted in a further 15 room types, as otherwise there would be no way to guarantee that you would receive the room type you had booked. This would have been extremely confusing for our guests. We are excited about the renovation and we encourage our staff to talk about it and obtain feedback from our guests. As an update on progress (using this as an opportunity for a plug) we have as of today renovated levels 4-16, levels 17-21 are currently being renovated and levels 22-34 are eagerly awaiting their turn. The renovation is due to be completed by January 2015. We look forward to welcoming you back soon.

(Shaun also graciously helped with leading us to the property and moving the associated luggage of 13 people!) Shaun took time to show us around the property and the accommodation (Hunky's homestead), had our hire cars ready and organised times for us to take our complimentary Norfolk Island 1/2 day tour. We were delighted by the amenities provided, the thoughtful provision of beach towels, WIFI, fan, local mobile phone with credit for us to use to contact Shaun directly, book restaurants or tours on island, and many books about the Island, ready for us to enjoy. So thoughtful! But, my favourite part of the home was the VIEW!

No lounge area except a cafe type bar. Given a leaky iron and when I went to unplug it, the entire casing came away from the wall leaving wires hanging out.

Westport was listed in one travel guide as ""with nothing to attract a passerby"" ... but Carters by the Sea is about 6km south and in a lovely little quiet and natural seaside town. Attached is a small bar/restaurant/grocery, and you can eat in Westport or in opposite direction to the south, Tauranga. Owners recommended Bay House which was perfect for us and the other couple we were traveling with. Hotel: first, it's called a motel, but for those among us Americans where that counjours a bad first impresstion -- IGNORE IT -- this is like a boutique hotel where you don't share a hallway. It is beautifully appointed and decorated, well stocked if you want to self cater. The grounds are cared for and in spectacular condition, like a great garden of flowers with small seating areas here and there. Location across from beach is beautiful. The beach is very long and gray with multiple layers of waves breaking offshore. There is almost nobody on the beach .... passed maybe 2 couples in about a mile. Interesting large driftwood, perfect for pictures. Service: Was friendly and very very helpful when we arrived and during our stay. When we left, we left a bag on our bed. We didn't realize it until we were 4 hours away in Marlborough, but the owners had tried to email us. When we called, they offered to ship the bag to us overnight to make sure it would arrive before we left Blenheim. Unbelievable service with a smile! The bag arrived safely less than 20 hours after we left it! And I'm sure the owners had to drive into Westport to get it posted and to us, but they gladly did it. Thank you Carters by the Beach!

Breathtaking ocean views from the bedrooms, combined with the soothing sound of the ocean to fall asleep to made for a pleasant stay.

The only negative was the air-con in the master bedroom was faulty and despite friendly maintenance/management staff attempting to fix it - the unit still didn't work. It's only a minor problem, but in a bid to try and impress the in-laws - who were already struggling with the QLD summer heat and humidity - it wasn't ideal.

The landscaping is plush. The pools are breathtaking and the grass is uber green. Everything about the hotel on the outside is beautiful. DO NOT LET THE LOBBY AND THE LANDSCAPING FOOL YOU! If you notice one thing 90% of the reviews of this hotel are good and posted by people who have only ever posted one review. That is something to be skeptical about to begin with. Notice that most of the negative reviews are posted by people who use tripadvisor alot. Something to think about! We got this hotel thru the name your own price feature thru Priceline so we were stuck with it. My boyfriend and I decided to go on a romantic trip at a local hotel as we live in ft lauderdale. Having never been to this hotel we figured it would be nice because its a Hyatt. Boy we were in for a rude awakening! The first room they put us in smelled very moldy and was disgusting. As I said my boyfriend and I wanted a romantic weekend, they only had rooms with doubles. Why hotels in 2011 put doubles in rooms and not queen beds is beyond me. The room also had the nosiest AC unit I have ever heard. It was like an upgraded Motel 6 room. We told management about the room being displeasing and they ""upgraded"" us complimentary to a different room type. It was in fact a little nicer but the air conditioning did not work at all. The room had a beautiful view of the pool but the AC not working in the room caused alot of problems. The room was supposed to have a fridge, you can tell because of the furniture had a fridge space, when u open the door it was empty with a big hole in the back of it. When requested a fridge they ""ran out"". Well they should of been in the rooms to begin with. My boyfriend and I really wanted to stay so that we could have a romantic evening but decided the plush landscaping wasnt worth a room with no AC and checked out. Management was completely unapologetic and could care less.

The day before I received an email offering an option to 'check in'. It was quick and easy to let them know roughly when we would be arriving, special instructions, and request where we wanted out room. We could have upgraded if we wanted. When we arrived, everything was ready. I showed ID and literally everything was ready. The room was clean, and modern for the most part. Our floor had an ice machine and pop machine, as well as some snacks we available at the front desk area for a reasonable price (some places are ridiculous). Front desk staff were friendly and professional no matter what time of day we saw them. Pool and hot tub area was nice, although I found the hot tub a bit hotter than I prefer. It was still very relaxing and clean. You'll have to ask for towels, as they don't have them in the pool area. We ate breakfast at Perkins, attached to the hotel. It was DELICIOUS! Very very well priced, huge portions, so many choices. I highly recommend eating there. Internet connection was the best I've had at any hotel. Overall we had an amazing weekend and absolutely our stay here was part of what made it so wonderful. Thank you!!",Your review will be shared amongst all the team at Travelodge Hotel Sudbury.

We booked the room and then paid an additional $70 for the romance package. This included a bottle of bubbles, 2 chocolates, a small teddy bear, cooked breakfast and a late check out (12pm). When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff. We got up to our room and they had put (fake) rose petals on the floor and bed. A little while later we were delivered our bottle of bubbles and our complementary glass of wine and chips. The room was to a high standard and very clean. The bed wasn't that comfortable and the 1 pillow we had each was worse. The cooked breakfast was very nice. My biggest complaint was not having any milk in the fridge for a morning coffee. Oh, and the cleaners trying to get into our room half an hour before check out while I was getting dressed after getting out of the shower.

3265711,Hotel,5,NSBooklover,FourSeasonsColorado,"Fabulous! ---SEP--- For our girlfriend's outing we chose the Four Seasons because of its excellent location and stellar reputation. We were not disappointed. Our 5 days there were fabulous. We were warmly welcomed the minute we stepped out of the cab. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything we needed. We were upgraded to a wonderful corner suite with expansive windows that gave us an enthralling view of the city and the Colorado foothills. The room was clean and inviting. A fruit basket arrived soon after. (One of our party stays at the Four Seasons whenever she is in town). We requested a rollaway because we were a group of 3. I've never slept on a more comfortable rollaway.....it supplied all the comforts of a conventional bed. The housekeeping staff was very willing to give us extra coffee, etc. whenever we asked. And the sinks light up at night, giving off a soft glow for nighttime wanderings. One small glitch: on our last day there, our room hadn't been cleaned by 3:30. We learned that we could have requested early room make-ups when we checked in. The hotel was very busy, seeming to host a conference every day. And yes, the bar during Happy Hour was quite crowded and noisy......pretty much what one would expect. A recent reviewer was very dissatisfied with her stay, giving an overall rating of one star. She claimed that the ""love, love"" reviews were bogus.....they are NOT! This review is very, very real.

My husband and I like to stay in nice hotels when we go away as it is our treat to ourselves and we were not disappointed. The rooms are well equipped, clean and spacious. Adequate for the money we paid. The hotel is perfectly located with the town center and pubs/ bars within a walking distance. The hotel bar is quite expensive (as in any hotel) but the quality of the drinks is brilliant. Cocktails are amazing and you even get a freshly prepared lemonade if you order alcohol with lemonade (I urge anyone to try it)... The only slight negative was the breakfast. My husband is gluten intolerant and there was no gluten free option. It would not be a problem as he wanted to build his own breakfast with options he could have and ordered 2x eggs, bacon etc. When his breakfast turned up it had 1x egg, 2x rushers of bacon and 1x mushroom. Not a lot to be fair. We explained the situation to the waitress the next morning and asked for a bit more food. However, the same breakfast had turned up! My eggs benedicts was equally as pathetic. It was very tasty but only got one poached egg with some ham on a whole English muffin. The continental breakfast assortment was not great either. Only 2 different types of cold meats, some bread, slices of one type of cheese, butter, but no cream/ soft cheese and not a lot else. Granted there was a good selection of cereals and fresh fruit. I am not sure why the hotel would be stingy on breakfast when they excel at the rest of the stuff.

It is a quick walk from the 3 Sisters viewing platform and tourist area and this is a plus. We stayed there for three nights. The room was rather dark, but on arrival seemed to be clean. It was relatively quiet . The aircon was quiet and effective. There was a large gap under the door and the whole place would have welcomed some paint. The room servicing consisted of changing the towels and emptying the garbage; anything else appeared to be too much bother. The beds were very uncomfortable. There was virtually no where outside to sit and enjoy the late afternoon/evening. Too much concrete and not enough customer focus.","Hi, Thank you for your feedback.

3188721,Hotel,2,Rick B,HISDenverDowntown,"Front Desk Blues ---SEP--- I stay at lots of Hilton Properties and understand when early check-in is not available but when a reserved room is not available, until two hours after the listed check-in time, it can be very inconvenient. The location of this property is very good and the hotel is well maintained. Everyone that I encountered, other than the front desk staff, was very friendly and welcoming. I have to believe that the owners are not aware of the childish behavior, on the part of the front desk staff, when they are away. I arrived at one o'clock and was immediately told by a young lady, with a mop of hair in her eyes, that check-in was not available until three PM. The tone was a bit condescending for someone in the service business and she seemed to be annoyed that I had arrived early. I checked my bag and went for a walk, returning around 2:30 PM. The room was still not ready, so I waited in the lobby / breakfast area. During the wait, I observed the housekeeping staff working diligently to get rooms ready, while three front desk staffers joked amongst themselves and with friends who ""dropped by"". My room was finally ready shortly before five PM. I asked for the bag that I had checked and handed the staff member my claim tag, only to discover that they had somehow misplaced my bag. After a few minutes it was located and I headed to my room. All of this completely without apology or explanation. One of the housekeeping staff did tell me that there was a sports event in town the night before and that lots of guests had been granted late check-out. Housekeeping didn't seem to be happy about the situation either. As an option, I would suggest the Downtown Hilton Garden Inn as a much better choice. The Downtown Marriott is also very good. If you don't have to be in the downtown area there are lots of good options around the airport. I won't take a chance on this place in the future.I should also mention that a number of other guests were also waiting for rooms and several left, electing to seek other accomodations, rather than wait.","Thank you for sharing your review of your time at the Hampton Inn & Suites Denver.

3326979,Hotel,5,Nipun Senadheera,Todd M,"Great location, large rooms! ---SEP--- First thing we noticed is how easy it was to access. One train stop from the airport, and you're right next to the hotel area. So it's really easy to get to the centre of the city too. The area has almost everything you need, a supermarket, salon, a bunch of food places - of which I loved the Japanese restaurant across the road to the station! Also spas, coffee shops etc. The hotel staff were very friendly and we got to the room really quick; and the room was with many surprises, starting with how large it was. A definite plus point was the washing machine and dryer they had - which made our lives so much easier. The TV had a great many number of channels and we were watching an interesting movie each night before calling it a night. The washroom was clean and nice, but without a bidet. We were able to cook a couple of our meals in the kitchen too, which was also well equipped and clean. tip: don't forget to get a public transport card from the airport. Also, if you want to avoid the airport charge via train, take the bus. But the extra cost is usually negligible considering the extra effort.","Dear Nipun S, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the TripAdvisor community.

3268658,Hotel,5,Micah_Reynolds,Jermaine A,"Stunning hotel with an amazing view ---SEP--- We stayed here for a night while making a stop in Chicago Wednesday before heading to the upper peninsula of Michigan for a wedding. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful on our first visit to Chicago, giving suggestions on sights during our brief time. The room was beautiful, quiet, and had a great view of the river (minus the Trump building). Everything was perfect. One suggestion from the front desk was the rooftop bar on the 22nd floor. We decided to check it out upon arrival and were bummed to see it closed until noon. We came back and the views and service beyond made up for the bar being closed when we originally wanted to go. We were promptly greeted by Tim, who made us feel welcome with his quick and witty banter (apparently he's a standup comic in the city, it showed). He went over the drinks and suggested his favorites, which we took him up on. I had an old fashioned, and my wife had the Roaring Twenties. Both were amazing. The Old Fashioned had to have been one of the best I've had in a long time. We had duck fat fries, as well as some sort of cheese bread and a basic salad. All of them were amazing, and are great for sharing. The bill was what you'd expect for a downtown rooftop (we're from NYC, so it was actually less than expected), running around 100 for a few drinks each and the food. Our afternoon at the rooftop at London House will be something we remember for years to come, and will suggest all of our local family visits. If only Chicago's unpredictable weather didn't cut our visit short, as it started raining shortly after we finished our food. Overall, our experience at London House was amazing. Superb service, outstanding accommodations, and incredible views have got us doing something we've never thought of doing before; planning a long weekend vacation to Chicago. I can guarantee that we will be staying at London House.","Hi Michah_Reynolds, Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for staying with us recently.

For the most part, they are very nice properties with service and amenities that fall in line with similar chains. The Embassy Suites Hilton Brandon is unlike any other of the hotels I‚Äôve stayed at in recent memory for one reason: The people. I was greeted, checked in and walked to the elevator by Zach at the reception desk. I noticed the way I was received immediately in the way he took extra care to make me feel welcome. That set the tone for the rest of the stay. The next morning I was immediately greeted by Annie and Diana who welcomed me to breakfast with a smile and warm greeting, not just the standard good morning. Chef Mike whipped me up an amazing omelet with a smile and the professionalism of executive chef. Again, it struck me how much each of these individuals cared and genuinely enjoyed what they were doing. Check out was just pleasurable as Allen repeatedly inquired as to how my stay was and genuinely asked me to return. People make the difference folks... These individuals made a weary business traveler feel like he was at 5 star resort with a private staff. Thank you to all for making this such an enjoyable experience.","Thank you so much for your recent 5 star stay!

When we later asked a shuttle driver how to get there he offered to drive us. If you like German food, try Old Heidelberg, it was excellent. Our fifth floor room was spacious and immaculate. It was suggested that we arrive for breakfast before 9am and we had no problem finding a place to sit. There were many choices for breakfast including make your own waffles. We signed up for the 11am shuttle and we were on our way to the pier shortly after 11. All in all an excellent pre cruise hotel. Thanks!","Hello there Carol M!!

3182502,Hotel,1,newyorker058,AshleyNCH,Avoid this hotel even if free ---SEP--- Travel is my business. I can allow for many things that may go wrong during a hotel stay but I could never allow for a consistantly bad customer service. Our flight was delayed. We arrived to the hotel 24 hours later than usual due to a big snow storm that closed many airports .....Needless to say we could not wait to get into a warm shower and comfortable bed. We were told by a cold front desk employee that we have no reservations. We showed them the travel agents reservations and their response sorry your reservations were for last night and if you do not show up they are cancelled entirely. We were surprised and said we were booked for five days and we missed one day but we still have 4 more reserved and already paid for in advance. Sorry nothing we can do says the young cold girl at the front sesk. She offered no suggestions. I said what can we do.? Her answer we have the space book the rooms again. it was for almost 200 dollars a night. was willing to accept but I thought maybe the front desk manager would have some helpful ideas. Big mistake to have bothered the front desk manager. He was upset that we even bothered him offered nothing but cold and non helpfel comments. I feel that he cares about his hair and glasses a lot more than he cares about business. we ended up staying the night and we would never go back even if free. All the staff that we had encountered at the front desk were cold and impersonal. They looked to me like they were reading from a script. The rooms were ok but nothing special. The view was horrible and the windows were dirty and we found old socks in the corner of the room. I would have never got mad about the socks if the front desck staff had any warmth or hospitality training in them. I feel the problem is an attitude problem that stems from the top. Do yourselves a favour and get rid of the front desk staff from top to bottom. even the staff on day shift when we checked out were made with the same ingredients as those ones from the night before. How sad you can have a nice property if you teach the staff the value of ncustomer service. The rest of the staff in the bar and dining broom as well as the valet were more friendly but far from fine. I am mvery surprised that westin keeps its name on your property. you need a lot of training to get close to where you should be.

Paid a little extra for the Classic Suite which had jacuzzi bath and sea views. The room was very nice and spotlessly clean. Bedlinen was not changed daily but towels were. Communal areas of the hotel were well maintained and inviting to guests (picture window lounge with views of Fistral beach very relaxing). The exception to this was the stairwells/corridors where the decor was a bit dated and dark. Restaurant appeared to have recently been modernised. We were given a good table with seaviews.

It was nice to check in, she had everything we needed in the house, it was very clean and comfortable for our 2 day stay. She was lovely to deal with, and you get to walk through the orchard and pick ripe fruits and eat them then and there! A good experience for most of us living in busy cities. There is also a feed of animals at 9am everyday which we enjoyed. The only problem we had was the shower had no hot water, or would keep jumping from hot to cold. When i spoke to Tara, she realised the gas had run out from the tank, which meant mum had to use the shower outside the cottage. It was fine given it was our last day. Overall a good experience! The drive from hobart was lovely, and the farm is very close to old town Richmond which we really enjoyed as well. There aren't that many dinner options, so we had to drive 15min to get to the closest Pizza place called Nates. I must admit the drive was worth it as their gourmet pizzas were amazing!

3291155,Hotel,5,nocturnalgirl72,MarriottDesertRidge,"Awesome staycation for my family ---SEP--- I booked this hotel as I had never stayed here before. I paid a total of $185 for 1 night and that included the resort fee, $50 resort credit, and kids eat free under the Swing and Fling package. It was not the cheapest hotel but it was worth it. The fee also included internet, and parking. They let me check in early so me and my kids could enjoy the pool. However I had trouble finding my room as its only accessible from one side of the lobby and there was a real lack of signage pointing people in the right direction. It took me a couple times to figure out where I was going as the place is huge. Room and bathroom was nice. A seperate tub and shower and plenty of room. The pools were awesome. There was also a lazy river. Over by the big pool with a fountain there was also a splash pad. There is also a slide by the lazy river. The kids eat free turned out to be a bargain. Even though I was the only adult and I ordered 1 adult entree, they comped both my kids meals at the StoneGrill both times. Tuscany was also included in this promo however I was not told I had to make reservations so Sat night we were unable to eat there so we went to Stonegrill. I was annoyed at first as Stonegrill menu was pricey, but I ordered a terrific burger/fries and soda, bill came to $20 and both the kids ate at the kids buffett for free. A dinner tab for 3 of $20 is almost unheard of at a resort. We also ate breakfast at the Stonegrill again my full buffett was a little pricey at $24 but both my kids ate free and they had a great selection and an omelette station. Service was outstanding. Our fridge in the room did not appear to be working so they sent maintenance up to fix it, it was frozen over. It was quickly repaired and then we got a follow up phone call to make sure it was fixed. I lost my key so we went to the front desk Sat night to get a new one and the gentleman there gave my kids 2 cute little stuffed animals. I have to gripe about something so here is a minor complaint. We went to the pool Sun morning and it appears they are really short staffed. People started making their way out to pool about 830am yet no staff handing out water until after 10. It was incredibly hot and with no beverages by the pool until after 10 seems like they need one person with the water cart earlier than 10. All in all my kids and I cannot wait to stay there again.","Thank you for your review! We are pleased to hear that you and your family had the opportunity to enjoy the Fling and Swing Package.

3214363,Hotel,5,John R,BryantParkHotel,"Great Midtown hotel ---SEP--- Loved our 4 night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel in a Junior Suite. First big plus, as the name suggests, is that it‚Äôs on Bryant Park which imparts sunlight and space in front of the hotel and gets away from the often claustrophobic nature of high rise streets in NYC (getting a Suite or a park facing room will make the most of the view) First impressions count after an 8 hour flight from the UK and John the doorman was so welcoming, but check-in was perfunctory and disinterested. This negative vibe was then rescued by Ricardo who showed us to our room, and who‚Äôs friendly nature set the tone for every other interaction with hotel staff members - all were wonderful with Andrew on the Concierge desk being especially helpful. Our Junior Suite was fantastic. A huge room by NYC hotel standards with minimalist modern decor, high ceilings, big windows and a truly massive bathroom with a deep soaking tub and separate walk in shower (made all the better by knock you over water pressure and Molton Brown toiletries). A happy birthday cake and balloon in the room was a nice touch and much appreciated. We were on the 16th floor and noticed NYC traffic noise the first night but after that it wasn‚Äôt an issue. Hotel lobby is quite small but the new Moroccan themed Celon bar in the basement is great for cocktails and Tapas. The Koi Sushi restaurant on the premises is also very good - pricey but worth it. Both the bar and restaurant get very busy in the evenings with city office workers, especially at weekends, so you need to reserve a table. Overall we really rated this hotel and preferred it to the nearby, pricier Archer Hotel that we stayed at on our last visit.","Hi John, Thank you for taking the time to review us and for remembering those employees that had such a positive impact on your stay.

3276454,Hotel,4,TheEasyGoingGuy,AshleyNCH,"Good choice in downtown Moncton ---SEP--- This is a newer Residence Inn, and a notch above other Residence Inn's I've stayed in. They offer the typical roomy Residence Inn studios and suites with every amenity required. Of note was how quiet the room was. Even though it's downtown, and even though there were rooms full of celebrating grads down the hall, I heard nothing. It must be well built with extra thick walls or soundproofing. A very peaceful and restful sleep in the most comfortable of beds. The staff is helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast offers lots of variety. They have one free computer to use in the lobby. I did not use the pool, but it looked clean. I expect though that it may be over-chlorinated as the smell was powerful. Parking is $12.00/night for hotel guests, with in and out privileges. Make sure you have the front desk validate your parking stub, and retrieve it from the machine every time you exit. Compared to its nearby competition - the Delta and Rodd - I certainly recommend the Residence Inn.","Thank you for your review on your recent stay with us! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our hotel, location and rooms. We have a salt water pool at the hotel and do not use chlorine.

3316406,Hotel,2,Kaiser96,Oceanskyhotel,"Staff friendly, the rest not to recommend ---SEP--- We had a warm welcome at the Ocean Sky and got rooms 908 and 910 with a connecting door. The door has not been used for a while, and has been paintet in the meantime that the color sticked the door to the wall.... After we opened it, you can imagine how dirty it was in between these two doors. One of the fridges was full of melted ice and so we called the front desk. A friendly room maid came immediately and cleaned the old carpet. As we had another fridge in the second room, it was not that bad that the dirty fridge stayed dirty until our departure. The balconies were very clean and the chairs comfortable. The view is great ‚Äì also during the night with the ocean on one and the lights of the city on the other side. The pool was nice and the area more or less clean. When we arrived there by 5 pm, we 6 were happy, cause we got the last 3 pool towels. The lady at the poolbar could not organize more towels cause she was not in charge. Opening hours oft he pool: 7.am to 11 pm. On a normal thursday no towels for the pool for more than a third of the whole opening time. Well, so we did not have to try the pool bar ‚Äì maybe the lady would also not be in charge. The old shower next to the pool was fun. We did not know that something like that still exists. There is an elevator directly from the pool deck to the rooms. This elevator was not working during our whole stay. Like this, we had to walk through the lobby with furniture of the fifties. A few more years and they will be modern again. Parking costs $12 per night which is a moderate prize. And what we really appreciate is the free WiFi. This is a service we think is great. What will await you in room 910: Aircondition is very old and loud but works. Not too confortable when you want to sit on the chair when it‚Äôs hot, cause the aircondition will blow warm air in your neck. 2 Lamps by the bed: are dirty but they work. Water in the bathroom: There is one way to stop the water: Bring it to one special position and try hard and you will manage that the water will not run the whole night. On the Hotel Information Manual you will find half of a chocolate bar on the second page. It looks like the room maids haven‚Äôt looked at it for a while ‚Äì so maybe you‚Äôll find it. Opening the balcony‚Äôs door is another challenge, but you will manage ‚Äì as we did. What you will find in room 908: The lamp standing next tot he window does not work. The same lamp as in the other room but luckily in the other room there was a button to bring it to work. We shouldn't have used the 3 coffee portions the first day, cause they haven't been refilled the coming day. On the 5th floor we once saw workers come into the elevator. It seems like there are a few things they renew. So I would suggest if you still are thinking of going to that hotel, maybe you could ask for a room on a floor that has been renewed. If the rooms would be as nice as the staff at the valet parking, front desk, concierge are friendly, it would be a lovely place. Why it's called ""Resort"" is another question.... With the check-out we mentioned that we did not like it there at all. The lady at the front desk was very sorry and told me to tell it the room service manager too... The problem of a bad condition of the rooms can unfortunately not be solved by only a room service manager...","As you mentioned, we have been renovating the hallways and just just the 5th floor but all of them.

3176764,Hotel,4,Kris091,Christopher N,"Relaxing stay ---SEP--- We just got back from a week long holiday at Peppers Palm Cove. Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best and we had several rainy days however what begins as a rainy day in Palm Cove can then turn into a beautiful sunny day a few hours later! Obviously this isn't the fault of Peppers and they had plenty of umbrellas on hand when needed. We had a 2 bedroom ocean front suite that we shared with my parents which was great and offered maximum privacy for each group. The king size beds and pillows were really comfortable and the sound of the ocean waves crashing was beautiful to listen to. The rooms were clean and serviced daily which is great coming back to a clean and tidy room. I was a little disappointed with the room service menu though. There were a couple of times we just felt like something simple to eat like a toasted sandwich or club sandwich but the room service menu is from the restaurant Lime and Pepper which I felt had limited options. I ended up having the gourmet beef burger one night which was just ok. I also felt like a dessert on another occasion but they sounded quite unappetising (pumpkin pudding with pineapple or plum mousse with sweet curry sauce). However I didn't call and ask if I could get something more simple so maybe there is more available if you ask? But Palm Cove has an amazing selection of restaurants, Vivo Bar and Grill was our absolute favourite and Il Forno Pizzeria was also great fun. The main pool at Peppers is amazing and was the main reason we booked to stay there as we were all keen on sitting around the gorgeous pool and swimming. I read somewhere that it was one of the only hotels in Palm Cove that had a heated swimming pool. However none of the pools were heated and they were all really really cold! We had one great sunny day that we all sat around the pool and swam however I could only get in for a very short time and didn't want to brave it again. I had to get my son out when his lips turned blue! We all had a swim but would have loved the water to have been a few degrees warmer so we were more comfortable. I left the main pool at one stage to go and get in the spa to get warm but it too was freezing, how strange. Another issue was the pool bar. A gentleman waiting behind me at one stage called it a debacle and I would have to agree. We were so disappointed that they didn't come around and take your drink and food orders around the pool, instead you had to go up to the bar and wait, order and wait again 15 to 20 mins for your cocktails and then carry them back on a tray which just didn't seem to be a 5 star way of doing things and ended up being a real pain and put a lot of pressure on the bar staff who were busy making cocktails whilst an irritated line of people watched on. However you can order food at the bar and they will bring it out to you, make sure you get the bucket of chips, they are in a huge bucket and were really yummy but again would have loved to see some more simple snack items on the menu that weren't deep fried like chicken or ham sandwich. After indulging at each breakfast and dinner sometimes you feel like something light for lunch or afternoon snack by the pool. We all thought the breakfast, which was included in our package, was great. A lot of variety and really yummy way to start the day. We didn't end up using the free wifi as it was pretty slow. The staff were all friendly and helpful when asked. My husband and I had a massage at the day spa which was lovely but pretty expensive and the hard sell of their products at the end turned me right off. Overall we had a really relaxing and fun holiday and were happy with the accommodation and service.","Dear kris091, Thank you very much for your feedback (particulalry on the menu offerings) and for taking the time to let us know how you felt.

While it is a notch below popular luxury brands such as the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and Park Hyatt, it's probably most akin to the JW Marriot brand.

3173717,Hotel,3,Carol E,Jarred M,"Interesting enigma ---SEP--- My husband and I visit Denver often as our son goes to Denver Uni. Howver, this time we visited after I injured myself skiing in Vail. We tried the Jacquard due to its great location in Cherry Creek. No complaints there with walking distance to the best shopping and restaurants. Hotel beds were very comfortable, breakfasts in their Restaurant wonderful. Lovely contemporary feel and quiet rooms. The refill drinking water on our floor was appreciated. Staff were friendly and courteous. So all good - BUT from the moment we entered our room on the fifth floor we noticed a bad smell - as if someone forgot to flush the toilet or perhaps even gas from fridge. We checked and all fine. Told reception who said they would get housekeeping to check it while we were out. My son had stayed in the room and said no one showed up. We found if we closed the toilet lid and bathroom door we could control the smell but ideally we should have changed rooms. Over four days we noticed the same smell also in a lift and other guests also noticed it. Then we realized the water in the toilet was going warm - which came to our attention because we left the lid down. So when we lifted it there was heat. I used to work in hospitality and noticed the engineer in the lift once so brought it to his attention. Was still not fixed while we were there and no one offered to move us or checked in with us about the complaint. Very disappointing. I got the feeling that the problem is well known by Hotel staff and it‚Äôs a nasty one at that. Strangest thing ever and definitely coming from the clean toilet water - perhaps it is something in the pipes?! I hope it is just teething problems but will avoid this Hotel for a while in the hope it will get sorted.

Weather it was the kind hearted Vicki or the fun loving Jay always ready to refill my wine glass or bring us an extra pillow, It was a consistent theme with every staff member. They really do care about their guest. I travel all over the country, this hotel in Phoenix AZ has set my new standard!! I will always stay here first in Phoenix and when I go to another city and state I will look for GreenTree inn brands first. We had many friends visit us over the last two stays. They were all impressed with the beautiful comfort of your hotel. Your staff even handles problems swiftly, professionally and with our best interests first. Why other brands can not do this I don‚Äôt understand. Your staff makes it seem effortless. I think Vicki and Jay are the hardest working individuals I have meet in years. Please continue doing what you are doing. We will see you Friday Through Sunday this week. I am so looking forward to being back at OUR new home away from home.

It's budget hotel and my expectations weren't especially high so I didn't take issue with the super low-flow shower pressure, loud A/C or lukewarm breakfast buffet and coffee. What drove me to write this review was the absolutely awful customer service I received from the front desk manager on the night of 6/24. I dropped off laundry monday am and was told it would be back in my room 6-7pm. When I returned at 7:30 it wasn't there so I called down to the front desk and was told that they didn't have my clothes and I should call the dry cleaner. When I explained that she's the one who should call the dry cleaner, she hung up on me. After 3 unanswered calls to the front desk, she finally answered to tell me my clothes never went to the dry cleaner and they were at the front desk. When I was asked for an explanation as to why this happened, she told me that she would have to get back to me and hung up. She never called me back and 5 calls to the front desk went unanswered before I had to go down to the front desk myself. At the front desk i was handed my clothes and offered no apology or explanation, in fact the front desk manager said absolutely nothing.

The usual creature comforts were at their usual high standard but, this trip, the food disappointed. On Friday, 15FEB2019, dinner was inedible. Didn't have the heart to bother the server, a delightful young man from Oakville, who was a pleasure to deal with. Not sure who was chef that night, but my ling cod and shrimp were so oversalted that 3 bites was all I could manage. These seafood choices are subtly flavoured, requiring a deft touch with seasonings. Dinner was a bust as a result. My wife was less than enamoured with her food as well. We'll be back, but the great room may be for morning coffee and a newspaper.... dinner not so much.

3275265,Hotel,3,TheFoodie8,AbbeyHotelGM,"gorgeous dog-friendly boutique hotel, just remember your earplugs!!! ---SEP--- I really recommend it as a hotel that allows dog, that was our priority, to find a nice mid-high range hotel that would allow dogs, and for that reason it fitted the bill. Our priority for this family trip was to bring our dog so we searched high and low for a hotel that allowed dogs, most of them were fully booked but luckily Abbey Hotel still had 2 rooms available. The dogs are not allowed to stay on the top floor so if you bring a dog you will be given either a basement room or on 2nd and 3rd floor. UNFRIENDLY FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF So apart from a staff member called Luke who assisted us with dog-friendly recommendations, most of the staff were pretty unfriendly. As you walked passed the reception they would be occupied amongst themselves and not really acknowledge you. When you did go up to ask a question they were quite blase about answering. They were generally fine but just don't expect 4-5* service from them. The least friendly and most abrasive was probably the female restaurant manager. It wasn't quite the tone or attitude I would expect of someone manager a hotel restaurant, especially one that is popular like this one. DON'T FORGET EARPLUGS This is a hard one, it's just unfortunate that the building is very old (although nicely renovated and decorated), so you hear EVERY SINGLE footstep. Now we took 2 rooms, one on the top floor and one in the basement, and we all lost sleep due to the noises of people running up and down the stairs, walking through the hotel and through the lobby...This was quite a let down for us because apart from that the hotel is very well decorated. Just be prepared with your earplugs I'd say. The breakfast is quite worth getting it's ¬£15 for a hot breakfast (I took the delicious full English breakfast) and then there is the buffet with the usual suspects (croissants, fruit juice, fruit, yoghurt, ham, cheese). GREAT LOCATION If you don't drive or prefer not to take the car, this is the perfect hotel as far as location is concerned. It's walking distance from the Roman Baths, all the shops and pubs too.","Dear TheFoodie8, Many thanks for taking the time to leave your review; all of your comments have been taken on board. I'm very glad we were able to accommodate your dog on your family trip and I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the location and decor of the hotel and the breakfast on offer. I'm very saddened to hear that you did not receive the high level of service from some of our staff that we usually pride ourselves on. I can only apologise; your issues have been raised and we will look to ensure that incidents like these do not happen again. I'm also sorry to hear that you lost sleep due to noise during your visit.

First room we checked into smelled horribly of smoke.We were then given a room at the back alley. We tried a third roomon the second floor. Unlike other places we have stayed, the crib was not set up for us. We had to go up a VERY steep makeshift platform to get to our room. With a stroller,it was very dangerous because it was so steep. NOT safe at all & should not be allowed. We lost control of the stroller on the way down! Its a good thing the baby was not in it!!!We were very disappointed and wanted to get out to enjoy Banff so did not complain but certainly will not be going back. Safety is worth the extra to stay elsewhere and I cannot understand how this passes code for a hotel!","Dear Guest, We're sorry to hear you were not satisfied during your stay with us. It was myself who came and checked the room after you advised there was a smoke smell, and I could smell it very faintly. Most likely it had come in through the open window from someone smoking in the car parking area. The new room we gave you was just down the hall from the original, backing onto the car parking area once more (not an alley). In regards to the ramp, these are in place so that the housekeepers can navigate their supplies sufficiently through the hotel. These are easily pulled up and fastened against the wall, so that guests can safely proceed up and down the small flights of stairs. The ramps should always be in the upright position once housekeeping has finished for the day, so our sincere apologies for the issue you experienced with this. We are now looking at taking these out and changing our procedures for the housekeepers.
